	Abstract = {In this Hypothesis and Theory paper, we consider the problem of learning deeply structured knowledge representations in the absence of predefined ontologies, and in the context of long-term learning. In particular, we consider this process as a sequence of re-representation steps, of various kinds. The Information Dynamics of Thinking theory (IDyOT) admits such learning, and provides a hypothetical mechanism for the human-like construction of hierarchical memory, with the provision of symbols constructed by the system that embodies the theory. The combination of long-term learning and meaning construction in terms of symbols grounded in perceptual experience entails that the system, like a human, be capable of memory consolidation, to manage the complex and inconsistent structures that can result from learning of information that becomes more complete over time. Such consolidation changes memory structures, and thus changes their meaning. Therefore, memory consolidation entails re-representation, while re-representation entails changes of meaning. Ultimately, the theory proposes that the processes of learning and consolidation should be considered as repeated re-representation of what is learned.

@article{McGregorAgresEtAl19,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel context-dependent approach to modelling word meaning, and apply it to the modelling of metaphor.  In distributional semantic approaches, words are represented as points in a high dimensional space generated from co-occurrence statistics; the distances between points may then be used to quantifying semantic relationships.  Contrary to other approaches which use static, global representations, our approach discovers contextualised representations by dynamically projecting low-dimensional subspaces; in these \textit{ad hoc} spaces, words can be re-represented in an open-ended assortment of geometrical and conceptual configurations as appropriate for particular contexts.  We hypothesise that this context-specific re-representation enables a more effective model of the semantics of metaphor than standard static approaches.  We test this hypothesis on a dataset of English word dyads rated for degrees of metaphoricity, meaningfulness, and familiarity by human participants.  We demonstrate that our model captures these ratings more effectively than a state-of-the-art static model, and does so via the amount of contextualising work inherent in the re-representational process.},

@article{JakubowskiBashirEtAl18,
	Abstract = {Comparisons between involuntarily and voluntarily retrieved autobiographical memories have revealed similarities in encoding and maintenance, with differences in terms of specificity and emotional responses. Our study extended this research area into the domain of musical memory, which afforded a unique opportunity to compare the same memory as accessed both involuntarily and voluntarily. Specifically, we compared instances of involuntary musical imagery (INMI, or ``earworms'')---the spontaneous mental recall and repetition of a tune---to deliberate recall of the same tune as voluntary musical imagery (VMI) in terms of recall accuracy and emotional responses. Twenty participants completed two 3-day tasks. In an INMI task, participants recorded information about INMI episodes as they occurred; in a VMI task, participants were prompted via text message to deliberately imagine each tune they had previously experienced as INMI. In both tasks, tempi of the imagined tunes were recorded by tapping to the musical beat while wearing an accelerometer and additional information (e.g., tune name, emotion ratings) was logged in a diary. Overall, INMI and VMI tempo measurements for the same tune were strongly correlated. Tempo recall for tunes that have definitive, recorded versions was relatively accurate, and tunes that were retrieved deliberately (VMI) were not recalled more accurately in terms of tempo than spontaneous and involuntary instances of imagined music (INMI). Some evidence that INMI elicited stronger emotional responses than VMI was also revealed. These results demonstrate several parallels to previous literature on involuntary memories and add new insights on the phenomenology of INMI.},

@article{van-den-TolEdwards15,
	Abstract = { Adults' (N = 220) reported motivations for listening to sad music after experiencing adverse negative circumstances were examined by exploring how their music selection strategies related to (a) their self-regulatory goals, and (b) reported effects of listening. The effects of music selection strategies, self-regulatory goals, and reported effects on the achievement of mood enhancement were also explored using a retrospective survey design. The findings indicate that music choice is linked to the individual's identified self-regulatory goals for music listening and to expected effects. Additionally, the results show that if individuals had intended to achieve mood enhancement through music listening, this was often achieved by first experiencing cognitive reappraisal or distraction. The selection of music with perceived high aesthetic value was the only music selection strategy that directly predicted mood enhancement. Where respondents indicated that they chose music with the intention of triggering memories, this was negatively related to the self-regulatory goal of mood enhancement. },

	Abstract = {Coecke et al. (2010) developed a compositional model of meaning for distributional semantics, in which each word in a sentence has a meaning vector and the distributional meaning of the sentence is a function of the tensor products of the word vectors. Abstractly speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. In this chapter, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear meaning map by presenting an algorithm for computing representations for various syntactic classes which have functional types; this algorithm results in assigning concrete corpus-based vector spaces to the abstract type of `sentence'. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whose basis vectors are pairs of words and grammatical roles. The concrete sentence spaces only depend on the types of the verbs of sentences; we use an embedding of these spaces and compare meanings of sentences with different grammatical structures by simply taking the inner product of their vectors in the bigger space. Our constructions are exemplified on a toy corpus.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Understanding and modeling human experience and emotional response when listening to music are important for better understanding of the stylistic choices in musical composition. In this work, we explore the relation of audio signal structure to human perceptual and emotional reactions. Memory, repetition, and anticipatory structure have been suggested as some of the major factors in music that might influence and possibly shape these responses. The audio analysis was conducted on two recordings of an extended contemporary musical composition by one of the authors. Signal properties were analyzed using statistical analyses of signal similarities over time and information theoretic measures of signal redundancy. They were then compared to Familiarity Rating and Emotional Force profiles, as recorded continually by listeners hearing the two versions of the piece in a live-concert setting. The analysis shows strong evidence that signal properties and human reactions are related, suggesting applications of these techniques to music understanding and music information-retrieval systems.},

@article{Pearce18,
	Abstract = {Abstract Music perception depends on internal psychological models derived through exposure to a musical culture. It is hypothesized that this musical enculturation depends on two cognitive processes: (1) statistical learning, in which listeners acquire internal cognitive models of statistical regularities present in the music to which they are exposed; and (2) probabilistic prediction based on these learned models that enables listeners to organize and process their mental representations of music. To corroborate these hypotheses, I review research that uses a computational model of probabilistic prediction based on statistical learning (the information dynamics of music (IDyOM) model) to simulate data from empirical studies of human listeners. The results show that a broad range of psychological processes involved in music perception---expectation, emotion, memory, similarity, segmentation, and meter---can be understood in terms of a single, underlying process of probabilistic prediction using learned statistical models. Furthermore, IDyOM simulations of listeners from different musical cultures demonstrate that statistical learning can plausibly predict causal effects of differential cultural exposure to musical styles, providing a quantitative model of cultural distance. Understanding the neural basis of musical enculturation will benefit from close coordination between empirical neuroimaging and computational modeling of underlying mechanisms, as outlined here.},

	Abstract = {Phenomenal theories of consciousness assert that this is due to specific neural correlates in the brain, which can be separated from all cognitive functions we can perform. If so, the search for robot consciousness seems to be doomed. In contrast, theories of functional or access consciousness assert that consciousness can be studied only with forms of cognitive access, given by cognitive processes. Consequently, consciousness and cognitive access cannot be fully dissociated. Here, the global features of cognitive access of consciousness are discussed based on neural blackboard or (global) workspace architectures, combined with content addressable or `in situ' conceptual representations as found in the brain. These representations allow continuous cognitive access in the form of a process of covert or overt queries and answers that could underlie forms of access consciousness. A crucial aspect of this process is that it is controlled by the activity of the in situ representations themselves and the relations they can initiate, not by an external controller like a CPU that runs a particular program. Although the resulting process of access consciousness is indeed based on specific features of the brain, there are no principled reasons to assume that this process cannot be achieved in robots either.},

@article{OakleyHalligan17,
	Abstract = {Despite the compelling subjective experience of executive self-control, we argue that `consciousness' contains no top-down control processes. We propose that `consciousness' involves no executive, causal or controlling relationship with any of the familiar psychological processes conventionally attributed to it. In our view all psychological processing and psychological products are non-conscious.  In particular, we argue that all `contents of consciousness' are generated by and within non-conscious brain systems in the form of a continuous self-referential personal narrative that is not directed or influenced in any way by the `experience of consciousness'. This continuously updated personal narrative arises from selective `internal broadcasting' of outputs from non-conscious executive systems that have access to all forms of cognitive processing, sensory information and motor control. The personal narrative provides information for storage in autobiographical memory and is underpinned by constructs of self and agency, also created in non-conscious systems. The experience of consciousness, is seen as a passive accompaniment to the non-conscious processes of internal broadcasting and the creation of the personal narrative.  In this sense personal awareness is analogous to the rainbow which accompanies physical processes in the atmosphere but exerts no influence over them. 

Though at an individual level it is an end-product created by non-conscious executive systems, the personal narrative serves the powerful evolutionary function of enabling individuals to communicate (externally broadcast) the contents of internal broadcasting. This in turn allows the recipients to generate potentially adaptive strategies, such as predicting the behavior of others and underlies the development of social and cultural structures, that promote species survival. Consequently, it is the capacity to communicate to others the contents of the personal narrative that confers an evolutionary advantage -- not the experience of consciousness (personal awareness) itself.},

@article{AgrilloDaddaEtAl09,
	Abstract = {Background Research on human infants, mammals, birds and fish has demonstrated that rudimentary numerical abilities pre-date the evolution of human language. Yet there is controversy as to whether animals represent numbers mentally or rather base their judgments on non-numerical perceptual variables that co-vary with numerosity. To date, mental representation of number has been convincingly documented only for a few mammals.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we used a training procedure to investigate whether mosquitofish could learn to discriminate between two and three objects even when denied access to non-numerical information. In the first experiment, fish were trained to discriminate between two sets of geometric figures. These varied in shape, size, brightness and distance, but no control for non-numerical variables was made. Subjects were then re-tested while controlling for one non-numerical variable at a time. Total luminance of the stimuli and the sum of perimeter of figures appeared irrelevant, but performance dropped to chance level when stimuli were matched for the cumulative surface area or for the overall space occupied by the arrays, indicating that these latter cues had been spontaneously used by the fish during the learning process. In a second experiment, where the task consisted of discriminating 2 vs 3 elements with all non-numerical variables simultaneously controlled for, all subjects proved able to learn the discrimination, and interestingly they did not make more errors than the fish in Experiment 1 that could access non-numerical information in order to accomplish the task.  Conclusions/Significance Mosquitofish can learn to discriminate small quantities, even when non-numerical indicators of quantity are unavailable, hence providing the first evidence that fish, like primates, can use numbers. As in humans and non-human primates, genuine counting appears to be a `last resort' strategy in fish, when no other perceptual mechanism may suggest the quantity of the elements. However, our data suggest that, at least in fish, the priority of perceptual over numerical information is not related to a greater cognitive load imposed by direct numerical computation.},

	Abstract = {Divergence is a multifaceted capability of multifaceted creative individuals. It may be exhibited to different degrees, and along different dimensions, from one individual to another. The same may be true of computational creative agents: Such systems may do more than exhibit differing levels of divergence: They may also implement the mechanics of divergence in very different ways. We argue that creative capabilities such as divergence are best viewed as cognitive services that may be called upon by cognitive agents to complete tasks in ways that may be deemed ``original'' or to generate products that may be deemed ``creative.'' We further argue that in a computational embodiment of such an agent, cognitive services are best realized as modular, distributed Web services which hide the complexities of their particular implementations and which can be discovered, reused and composed as desired by other Web-aware systems with diverse creative needs of their own. We describe the workings of one such reusable service for generating divergent categorizations on demand and show how this service can be composed with others to support the generation and rendering of novel metaphors in an autonomous Twitterbot system.},

	Abstract = {Computational creativity is a flourishing research area, with a variety of creative systems being produced and developed. Creativity evaluation has not kept pace with system development with an evident lack of systematic evaluation of the creativity of these systems in the literature. This is partially due to difficulties in defining what it means for a computer to be creative; indeed, there is no consensus on this for human creativity, let alone its computational equivalent. This paper proposes a Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative Systems (SPECS). SPECS is a three-step process: stating what it means for a particular computational system to be creative, deriving and performing tests based on these statements. To assist this process, the paper offers a collection of key components of creativity, identified empirically from discussions of human and computational creativity. Using this approach, the SPECS methodology is demonstrated through a comparative case study evaluating computational creativity systems that improvise music.},

@phdthesis{Whorley13,
	Abstract = {This research is concerned with the development of representational and modelling techniques employed in the creation of statistical models of melody and four-part harmony. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of multiple viewpoint systems, along with techniques such as Prediction by Partial Match, in the construction of cognitive models of melodic perception. Primitive viewpoints represent surface and underlying musical attributes, while linked viewpoints model combinations of such attributes. A viewpoint selection algorithm optimises multiple viewpoint systems by minimising the information theoretic measure cross-entropy. Many more linked viewpoints are used in this research than have previously been available, and the results show that many new viewpoints are incorporated into optimised systems. 

A significant aspect of this work is the proposal and implementation of a set of novel extensions of the multiple viewpoint framework for four-part harmony. Statistical models are constructed with the aim that given a soprano part, alto, tenor and bass parts are added in a stylistically suitable way. Version 1 is as closely related to the modelling of melody as possible (chord replacing note), and is a baseline for gauging expected improvements as the framework is extended and generalised. Three versions of the framework have been implemented, and their performances compared and contrasted. The results indicate that the baseline version has been improved upon. Time complexity issues are discussed in detail, and selected viewpoints are examined from a music theoretic point of view for insights into why they perform well. Finally, melodies and harmonisations of given melodies are generated using the best performing models. The quality of the music suggests that, in spite of the improvements achieved so far, the models are still unable to fully capture the musical style of a corpus. Another six versions of the framework are described, which are expected to contribute further improvements.},

	Abstract = {We  compare and discuss representations in two cognitive architectures aimed at representing and processing complex conceptual (sentence-like) structures. First is the Neural Blackboard Architecture (NBA), which aims to account for representation and processing of complex and combinatorial conceptual structures in the brain. Second is IDyOT (Information Dynamics of Thinking), which derives sentence-like structures by learning statistical sequential regularities over a suitable corpus. Although IDyOT is designed at a level more abstract than the neural, so it is a model of cognitive function, rather than neural processing, there are strong similarities between the composite structures developed in IDyOT and the NBA. We hypothesize that these similarities form the basis of a combined architecture in which the individual strengths of each architecture are integrated. We outline and discuss the characteristics of this combined architecture, emphasising the representation and processing of conceptual structures.},

	Abstract = {Chapter 6: Learning theory and practice.
            Surveys a number of learning theories, these are
            classified along two dimensions: the role of the stimulus, and
            connectionist vs cognitive.
            Stimulus: reactive (organism passively responds to stimuli)
                      structural (organism is active, as well as
					   responsive)
            Connectionist: (behaviourist) - learning is linking a
                      stimulus to a response.
            Cognitive: interested in cognitive structures and brain
                      mechanisms
            Describes theories of Watson, Thorndike, Hull, Pavlov,
            Skinner (all connectionists) and Tolman, Lorenz, Broadbent, Lunzer
            (intermediate) and Locke, Gestalk psychologists, Piaget, Lewin
            (cognitive).
            Discusses early ITS's: multi-choice questions (Pressey, 1926)
                                   linear programs (Skinner, 1954, operant
						    conditioning, step-wise
						    reward system)
                                   branching programs (Crowder, 1955,
						       remedial
						       loop,less
						       emphasis on
						       knowledge of
						       results, larger
						       steps),
           Theories have much in common, wrt to teaching strategies:
           - learning can be encouraged by using intrinsic
             (exploration, manipulation, achievement) and extrinsic
             (praise, reproof, incentives) rewards
           - immediate relevance and importance is highly motivating
           - habits of thinking (ways of solving problems) are laid
             down early in life as learning sets, and apply to
             cognitive and social behaviour.
           - knowledge of results has reinforcement value
           Wholistic or bottom-up approaches are both useful, for the
           right child with the right material. Ditto for discovery
           learning vs verbal presentation.

	Abstract = {75 Students used MEDICI, a computer based aural training
	program for a year as part of their coursework, and were then given a
	questionnaire about it.
They liked the positive feedback and encouragement.
Most (80%) didn't like the system as a whole, whereas they liked ear
	training in the classroom (86%).  Thought it took too much time.
System was unreliable.
93% felt that instantaneous judging was important, but only 31%
	thought MEDICI offered more feedback than a clasroom instructor - all
	MEDICI did was mark the difference between a student's input and the
	correct input (also shown).  Did not then act on student's weakness in
	any way.  Most students found the timbre of the sound used to be
	annoying.
MEDICI made it easy for students to cheat - could get a better student
	to use their ID.

Related to the fact that events take time to happen, hence, interval

Davidson - reification of events.
(Never named - Russell's theory of description?)

McDermott's events: not fact changes. Not a fact that obtains for a certain
period (ok for `some aimless thing happening for a while') (Galton's atelic
events). Instead, goes for external description - an event is just the interval
over which it occurs.

Allens: properties, processes and events. [Perhaps processes actually
imply 'in the process of completing an event'?]

	Abstract = {The author presents a conceptual model of creative
 thinking in music, basing the model on past research and
 speculation. Elements of the model include groups of enabling
 conditions, enabling skills, and a central process that is seen as a
 movement from preparation to verification. There is discussion of the
 divergent/convergent thinking process as it relates to the three
 principle ways man involves himself with music: composition,
 performance/improvisation, and analysis (listening). The article
 concludes with a look into the possibilities of future research,
 including use of the author's own Measure of Creative Thinking in
 Music, ethnographic research, and computers and synthesizers.},

	Abstract = {Musical time can be considered to be the product of two
 time scales: the discrete time intervals of a metrical structure and
 the continuous time scales of tempo changes and expressive timing. In
 musical notation both kinds are present, although the notation of
 continuous time is less developed than that of metric time (often
 just a word like 'rubato' or 'accelerando' is notated in the
 score). To make sense of most musical styles, it is necessary to
 separate the discrete and continuous components of musical time. The
 authors call this process of separation quantization, although the
 term is generally used to reflect only the extraction of a metrical
 score from a musical performance. They look at connectionist
 approaches to quantisation of musical time, and present a basic
 model, including a program in CommonLISP.},

	Abstract = {Neural networks provide a very different approach to
 computing; they eliminate both the processor/memory dichotomy and the
 concept of a symbolic instruction set. Instead, they provide an
 essentially analog network of idealized 'neurons' in which different
 patterns of excitation are observed as a function of the
 interconnections between neurons. Processing and memory are
 distributed uniformly throughout the network in a form ideally suited
 for implementation with extremely fast and highly parallel hardware,
 such as optical computing and analog VLSI. Equally significant neural
 networks often provide learning mechanisms so that the desired
 computation can be programmed simply by repeatedly exposing the
 network to examples of the desired behavior. The network merely
 adapts its interconnections until the resulting pattern of
 excitations is as close to the desired behavior as it can manage. The
 author provides both an introduction to this important new
 programming technique and some simple examples of its musical
 utility.},

@mastersthesis{Conklin90,
	Abstract = {This thesis develops and evaluates predictive theories
  of music. Good theories should model a particular class of music and
  predict new pieces in the class with high probability. Attention is
  restricted to melody alone -- harmony and polyphony are not
  considered. Theories are constructed using an empirical learning
  approach, and to construct and evaluate them, one hundred Bach
  chorale melodies are analyzed.  Theories are evaluated by a data
  compression measure, which is a strong indicator of their predictive
  power. The entropy of the chorales is estimated by averaging the
  amount of compression given to a test set using a theory learned
  from a training set. The central hypothesis is that the chorales are
  quite redundant in the information theoretic sense. A novel approach
  to the induction of sequence generating rules, called multiple
  viewpoints, is created. This method is based on the variable--order
  Markov model, with extensions to incorporate timescales and parallel
  streams of description. A multiple viewpoint system comprises two
  parts: a long--term theory which adapts to a class of sequences, and
  a short--term theory which adapts to a particular instance of the
  class. Predictions from both are combined into an overall
  prediction. The performance of several different multiple viewpoint
  systems is assessed on the chorale data. The redundancy of the
  chorales is thereby estimated to be 55\%. This thesis concludes that
  the estimate must be compared with human performance at the same
  predictive task. The theory should also be evaluated in terms of the
  quality of the new chorales it generates, and by its ability to
  discriminate chorales from non--chorales.},

@article{ConklinWitten90,
	Abstract = {This note opens with a commentary on the Georgescus'
  visionary paper entitled {"A systems approach to music,"} which
  established an ambitious framework that encompasses a wide range of
  musical phenomena.  Attention is concentrated on the higher--level
  aspects; in particular, the notion that the evolution of musical
  genres may exhibit structural instability by shifting to new musical
  paradigms, and the radical extension of this notion to the
  identification of morphogenesis in individual works. It is argued
  that structural discontinuities relate to creative processes rather
  than to artistic works per se, because they correspond to a
  breakdown of the listener's predictive model of the music. This
  focuses attention on the problem of deriving predictive models for
  particular musical pieces and genres -- the subject of our own
  research. We equate predictive power with the ability of a model to
  compress the musical surface (roughly, text) of unseen
  works. Following a brief examination of theories for analyzing and
  generating music, the methodology of adaptive modeling and
  compression is set out, and extended from its conventional domain of
  strictly sequential natural language text to the much richer musical
  surface through the use of multiple viewpoints -- specialized
  knowledge sources that deal with particular aspects of music.
  Finally, we discuss how the performance of models formed adaptively
  might be compared with that of live musicians, and outline an
  experiment currently in progress to establish how well human
  subjects can predict the musical surface of Bach Chorales.},

		2. Bug category - did it arise during program

		3. Bug cause - small stack of schemas used.
		4. Tutorial goals - might want to do further

	Abstract = {NEUROGEN has been designed with a view to producing small
 diatonic, western--type, four--part harmony compositions using the
 knowledge extracted from a set of example musical fragments provided
 by the user. The aim has been to produce a piece of coherent music
 that resembles that typically found in traditional hymns. A set of
 neural networks are used to capture the conceptual ideas that build
 'good' music and this knowledge is then used to direct a search for
 the ultimate composition. Genetic algorithms hold many member states
 representing partial musical fragments. The neural networks cooperate
 to produce a heuristic value that represents the worth of each of
 these musical fragments. This value is then used to evolve better
 compositions based on fragments with high fitness values. The use of
 Neural Networks as an evaluation function has proved successful in
 the guidance of genetic algorithms. This success is evident in the
 type of composition produced by NEUROGEN.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes how evolutionary techniques of
 variation and selection can be used to create complex simulated
 structures, textures, and motions for use in computer graphics and
 animation. Interactive selection, based on visual perception of
 procedurally generated results, allows the user to direct simulated
 evolutions in preferred directions. Several examples using these
 methods have been implemented and are described.  3D plant structures
 are grown using fixed sets of genetic parameters. Images, solid
 textures, and animations are created using mutating symbolic lisp
 expressions. Genotypes consisting of symbolic expressions are
 presented as an attempt to surpass the limitations of fixed--length
 genotypes with predefined expression rules. It is proposed that
 artificial evolution has potential as a powerful tool for achieving
 flexible complexity with a minimum of user input and knowledge of
 details.},

@article{Todd91,
	Abstract = {With the advent of von Neumann--style computers, music
 composers can now develop algorithms embodying the compositional
 rules they are interested in and then use a computer to carry out
 these algorithms. The arrival of a new paradigm for computing has
 made a different approach to algorithmic composition possible. This
 new computing paradigm is called parallel distributed processing
 (PDP), also known as connectionism. The author presents a particular
 type of PDP network for music composition applications. Various
 issues are discussed in designing the network, choosing the music
 representation used, training the network, and using it for
 composition. Comparisons are made to previous methods of algorithmic
 composition, and examples of the network's output are presented. The
 author provides an indication of the power and range of PDP methods
 for algorithmic composition in order to encourage others to begin
 exploring this approach. Hence, rather than merely presenting a
 reduced compositional technique, alternative approaches and
 tangential ideas are included throughout as points of departure for
 further efforts.},

@inproceedings{Todd91a,
	Abstract = {A new approach to computer art applications is provided by
 the rapidly expanding field of neural networks. Rather than operate
 in the traditional style of preprogrammed rule--following systems,
 neural networks have the power to *learn* to produce specific types
 of outputs from specific inputs, based on examples they are
 taught. Thus, instead of having to specify *how* to create a certain
 artwork, the artist can instead teach a network *examples* of the
 desired output, and have the network generate new instances in that
 style. We need not specify the steps involved in creating a Rodin
 sculpture -- we can just collect instances of the sorts of sculpture
 we'd like to get and use those to train a network. This sort of thing
 is the promise of neural network applications in the arts, stated in
 a very provocative and exaggerated manner. But we are beginning to
 realize this promise in limited domains, and the space for further
 applications and explorations of these techniques is wide open. In
 this paper, I will briefly describe neural networks, some of what
 they can and can't do, some of what they have done already in the
 arts, primarily music, and some of what they can be applied to in
 other areas.},

@techreport{WittenConklin91,
	Abstract = {The topic of music theory evaluation has recently
  aroused heated debate within the music theory community (Journal of
  Music Theory, 33(1), 1989). This paper develops a class of theories
  called \fImultiple viewpoint systems\fR. A multiple viewpoint theory
  of music is a collection of independent views on the musical
  surface, each modelling and predicting specific types of musical
  phenomena. When and why is one theory of music to be preferred over
  another? Some researchers believe that the notion of preference can
  be formalized, and others that it is subjective and based on
  esthetic criteria. This paper attempts a conciliation of these two
  views. On one hand, we believe that the best theory of a musical
  concept generates creative, esthetically more pleasing instances of
  the concept, and that this part of music theory evaluation cannot be
  truly objective. However, we conjecture that predictive power is a
  sufficient condition for esthetic quality. Predictive power is
  measured by performing inductive inference over a sample, and
  estimating the entropy, or complexity of the concept by applying
  rigorous tests to the theory. Musical concepts are not static;
  although some broad generalizations can apply, other generalizations
  are forced to change from piece to piece. To model this effect, we
  use a \fIlong--term\fR model which represents the general musical
  concept, and a \fIshort--term\fR model which adapts to a particular
  piece. The methods outlined in this paper are applied to the musical
  concept of {"next event in a Bach chorale melody".} Short and
  long--term multiple viewpoint systems are induced from a sample, and
  applications of the preference evaluation are given.},

	system included the use of musical passages in multiple voices, which

	Students' attitudes were mostly positive.  Exercises used longer

	and compare with in-tune version), judging (students identify location
	and type of errors in examples) and tuning (students alter pitches to
	tune examples)
Student listens to example any number of times, and can also listen to
	an in-tune version.  Then indicates through multiple choice what the
	problem is.  Yes/No feedback immediately.  Can try again if wrong.  If
	wrong too many times, right answer is displayed.  Also had a 'quiz'
	(testing) mode in which in-tune references were not available.
Difficulty levels correspond to level of mistuning, controlled
	automatically by system for good performance on a quiz (student can

Had similar effects on different ability levels.

 fields of musicology, psychology and computer science.  Nowadays each
 of these domains is linked to the other in various research
 disciplines. In computer music, ways to design machines to make music
 are explored. In music cognition, mental processes that perceive and
 apprehend music are investigated. In artificial intelligence the mind
 is approached as a machine -- and machines are built to learn more
 about the mind. The articles collected in this volume focus on the
 perception and representation of musical time and temporal structure,
 commonly identified as a research area crucial to the understanding
 of the complex processes that enable us to enjoy and perform

	Abstract = {The information content, or {"entropy"}, of a piece of
  music cannot be determined in the abstract, but depends on the
  listener's familiarity with, and knowledge of, the genre to which it
  belongs. This paper describes an experiment designed to investigate
  human listeners' models of music by having them guess successive
  notes in a piece. The experiment was administered by a computer
  program, and in order to elicit subjective probabilities, listeners
  gambled on the notes they guessed. The study was restricted to the
  music of the Bach Chorales, and, in particular, on the succession of
  pitches that comprise the melody -- although our methodology is also
  generally applicable to other musical parameters, and to other
  genres. A tournament was held, with categories of novice,
  intermediate, and expert musician. As well as providing an overall
  measure of entropy for each of two chorale melodies, the results
  yield entropy profiles for the individual chorales. These give an
  objective, scientifically repeatable record of the note--by--note
  information content of the melodies, which can be interpreted
  musically in terms of expectation, suspense, and resolution in the
  music.},

	Abstract = {Goal of I.D. is to design a sound curriculum.  Current
	methods are unscientific.  Development of the Piano Tutor lead to a
	formal model for I.D.
	The basic principle of I.D. is that all concepts in the
	curriculum should be defined behaviourally, so that what is
	taught is observable and measurable by performance-based
	learning criteria.
        Computers can contribute to the development of methods for the
	systematic development of instruction.
        The aim of I.D. is to achieve instructional integrity.  Goals
	are:
	1. Only test what has already been taught.
        2. Articulate objectives in behavioural terms.
        3. Curriculum should describe what the student has to do to
	   demonstrate understanding.
        Describes the Piano Tutor curriculum representation:
        Consists of lessons, skills and objectives. A lesson is a
	single interaction which addresses one or two concepts.
        Then describes analysis algorithms - mainly graph processors
	which identofy lessons/skills which are unreachable, useless,
	unattainable, equivalent.  Also computes the shortest path through the
	curriculum, and identifies critical (essential) lessons.  They say
	these techniques can speed up lesson design in ITS's.  },

 representational system for music. Following decisions as to the
 primitives of such a system, their time structure and general
 structuring is discussed. Most of the issues are presented as
 controversies, using extremes to clarify the underlying
 problems. Associating time intervals and their constraints with the
 components of musical structure turns out to be essential. These
 constraints on time intervals model an important characteristic of
 musical knowledge and should be part of the representation, i.e. part
 of the syntax. It is concluded that a representation of music should,
 in the short run, be made as declarative, explicit and formal as
 possible, while actively awaiting representation languages that can
 deal with the presented issues in a more flexible way.},

@article{Large93,
	Abstract = {Developed in context of study of music performance errors.
	Polynomial time (cubic in input size, roughly) algorithm based on
		dynamic programming techniques.
	Performers are expected to produce pitch accurately, but
		timing and dynamics can be altered for expressive
		effect.  Can be hard to distinguish such deviations
		from actual errors.
	Used to analyse errors of pianists (adult and child) with
		widely varying skill levels - some pieces were played
		nearly perfectly, while others were barely
		recognisable.  Some were long and complex, with
		thousands of events.
	4 types of matching result - match (event performed
		correctly), substitution (wrong pitch), addition
		(extra event), and deletion (missing event).
	Total match score for a piece - 2 for each match, 1 for
		each substitution.  Solution is highest score
		possible.  Number of possible matches grows
		exponentially with input size, so can't use brute
		force search.  However, an optimal solution has the
		property that it contains optimal solutions to
		subproblems.  Can therefore use dynamic programming
		to reduce search time by avoiding recomputing
		solutions to subproblems.  Subproblem solutions are
		stored in a table for reuse.
	Table is built from bottom right upwards, row by row, then
		solution is read from top left down.  At each point,
		choose the leftmost bottommost match with the highest
		score. Strangely, the first match is chosen from the
		first column - no provision for it being on the forst
		row, in other columns (ie initial event was deleted.)
	Large's implementation optimises the finding of the solution
		by storing the row and column maximae, eliminating
		the row and column searches, complexity is then square
		of the input size.  Chords - compound events use a
		more complex scoring function.
	Scoring function usually allows multiple optimum
		correspondences, even when seems unambiguous to a
		human, because event similarity and temporal structure
		are not considered.  Actual program scores events on
		basis of similarity and allows user to adjust the
		scoring function, and weights exact matches more
		heavily.
	Estimate the error coding accuracy of the algorithm to have
		over 90% agreement with human judges.},

	Abstract = {Looks at the cognitive psychology of music - how music is
		percieved and understood.
            Some psychological studies are not really musically valid, some
		confuse the way people listen to music with the way they
		describe it, or the culture in which they are listening to
		it.  Others place too much emphasis on notation.
            Do people hear tonal structure? - GTTM - an explicit formal
		musical grammar that models the listener's connection
		between the presented musical surface of a piece and the
		structure he attributes to the piece.  Transfers ideas from
		language - that there is an underlying grammar.  Experiments
		(Deliege) showed reasonable correspondance between how people
 		divide the surface structure of a piece, and GTTM's
		predictions.  Musicians closer to model.  However, does not
		validate the hierarchy lying above the surface structure.
		Controversy over whether people do actually listen in a tonal
 		way, since they seem tolisten to atonal music similarly, and
		use similar rules, largely based on salience (timbre,
		register, dynamics, metrical position and other stuff) to
		divide such pieces.  There is evidence against tonal closure
		having the predicted effect, except in very short musical
		extracts (much less than a minute).
	    Critics of L&J, and similar theorists, say that it isn't valid
		to transfer the idea of a grammar from language, because
		grammer in language applies to a small perceptual unit - a
		sentence - which can be held wholly in memory.  And the
		grammar describes the deep structure of the sentence.  People
 		cannot remember whole long pieces, and also do not use them
		to communicate in the same way as language is used, so such
		internal analysis isn't necessary.
	    In GTTM, higher level nodes are selections from lower levels,
 		rather than abstractions, and cannot form the core of music
		perception.
	    Another problem in applying linguistic models to music is
		pragmatics, or the distinction between competence and
		performance (the formal system versus its actual use).
		GTTM is supposed to be a model of the formal system, but
		cannot be tested except through use.  Also, different music
		styles/composers/pieces have different grammars.  Listener
		must construct grammar as they listen.  So it's not a formal
		grammar in the linguistic sense, more of a collection of
		strategies for understanding music. So GTTM is really a way
		of producing a structural description from a musical surface.
	    Tonal hierarchy theory - people are trying to make a pedagogical
		model into a psychological theory.  Very controversial.
	    Composer can't just stuff structure into music and expect
		listeners to be able to reconstruct it.  How far do people
		reconstruct structure when they listen to music?  Evidence
		that people CAN listen gramattically if they choose to (or
		are instructed to in an experimental situation) but generally
		listen holistically when listening for pleasure. eg students
		were played incomplete movements from Haydn symphonies and
		then asked to say where in the form the music had stopped.
		First time did little better than guesswork.  But subsequently
 		did well - once they knew what to listen for.  So do
		listeners really decode structures that composers have
		encoded in music?  Usually not.  Theory says more about
		composers than listeners.},

@article{CovingtonLord94,
	Abstract = {Aural training is beset with frustrations for both
		learners and instructors.  Students find that the
		training does not seem to match what they will do as
		professional musicians, the focus is on pitch and
		rhythm and excludes other important factors (timbre, dynamics,
		articulation, ...), and its difficult to see how aural
		training connects to other aspects of the music
		curriculum.
	    Instructors find that the requirement for numerical
		assessment drives them to base training on short,
		quantifiable, simple examples.  Isolated drill tasks
		exclude work with full musical contexts.  The
		bottom-up approach leaves integration of skills until
		quite late on, if it happens at all.  Also, what about
		highly skilled performers who aren't good at these
		aural tests?  Does this problem indicate a problem
		with what is being taught and assessed?
	    The authors have reexamined the goals and means of aural
		training. Music cognition research is not yet at the
		stage of being able to present much of a cohesive
		theory.
	    Objectivist model - prevalent model of cognitive training
		in aural skills.  Target knowledge base consists of a
		set of facts and skills. (Declarative and procedural
		knowledge).  Knowledge represented as some form of
		schema-based hierarchy/expert system.  Schemas are
		hypothesised and teaching targets them individually.
		Behavioural approach.  Assessment based on retrieval.
	    Limitations: no guarantee that the skills can be
		transferred from isolated examples to real contexts.
		Also, training without a real context can produce
		weak, inflexible schemas.  Teaching emphasises
		separation rather then integration.  Could develop
		barriers.
	    Music cognition research hasn't much to say because it is
		also mainly focussed on isolated factors and
		quantifiable measurement, which limits what can be
		examined. Not enough of an overall theory yet.  Most
		of the research is also behavioural in nature.
	    Some insights from domain-independent educational theory:
		objectivist model is suitable for well-structured
		domains (eg arithmetic, spelling) where facts and
		procedures are highly rule-based and not
		context-dependent.
		It may not be suitable for ill-structured domains,
		where prototypes can be misleading, hierarchical relations of
		dominance can be reversed in different cases, features assume
		different patterns of significance in different
		contexts, there are higher-order interactions between
		features. Aural perception of music has many of these
		features (they give examples).  They observe that if
		music were well-structured it would cease to be an
		art form, and varied hearings and readings of a piece
		would not be possible.
	    The alternative paradigm for ill-structured domains:
		constructivism.  To be significant, learning must be
		usable in new situations.  Prior experience is
		important.
	    They conclude that: cognitive processes in WSDs are far
		better understood than those in ISDs.  Theories
		appropriate for WSDs are inappropriate for ISDs.  One
		of the biggest problems in using WSD techniques to
		teach ISDs is that knowledge transfer is excluded.
		Transfer is best promoted by representations which
		have multiple interconnections between aspects of
		domain knowledge, multiple representations of cases,
		and don't oversimplify. Emphasis should shift from
		retrieving information to assembling fragments of
		experience to match the current situation.  Case-based
		presentation is the best method of achieving the
		necessary flexibility.
	    Bit like cognitive apprenticeship.  Other names for
		constructivist are {"situated cognition"} or {"anchored
		instruction".}
	    Dealing with one situation in multiple ways reinforces
		interconnections between aspects.  Student doesn't
		need to make effort to keep learning a new situation.
	    Assessment: facts/skills are tested as integral subtasks
		of solving the cognitive problems presented.  transfer
		of knowledge is also tested, since the assessment
		presents a new context and students must transfer
		their existing skills.
	    Constructivist methodology is already used when teaching analysis,
		and in other domains.
	    They have been developing their aural skills curriculum
		along these lines.  They train students to focus on a
		particular aspect of a musical fabric (melody, bass
		line, piano part, ...).  Then go on to harmony.  Can
		isolate parts, provide new harmonisations, analyse the
		existing ones in different ways, ...
	    Focus is on application of knowledge, rather than
		retrieval.  Students work with same musical context
		for an extended period.  Encouragement of varied
		responses.
	    Call for a paradigm shift in aural training.},

 style oriented music generation. We describe a system where music
 generating functions are automatically produced with help of genetic
 algorithms. Genetic algorithms are search and machine learning
 procedures that are based on natural selection. Genetic algorithms
 such as any other algorithms can be used to produce musical
 output. There are few basic approaches when using genetic algorithms:
 they can be used as an optimising method to solve complex
 parameterised and/or rule based problems. Genetic algorithms are also
 widely used on solving problems by generating functions that will
 perform the selected task the most effectively. This concept is
 explored in this contribution.},

	Abstract = {In algorithmic music composition, a simple technique
 involves selecting notes sequentially according to a transition table
 that specifies the probability of the next note as a function of the
 previous context. An extension of this transition--table approach is
 described, using a recurrent autopredictive connectionist network
 called CONCERT. CONCERT is trained on a set of pieces with the aim of
 extracting stylistic regularities. CONCERT can then be used to
 compose new pieces. A central ingredient of CONCERT is the
 incorporation of psychologically grounded representations of pitch,
 duration and harmonic structure. CONCERT was tested on sets of
 examples artificially generated according to simple rules and was
 shown to learn the underlying structure, even where other approaches
 failed. In larger experiments, CONCERT was trained on sets of
 J.S. Bach pieces and traditional European folk melodies and was then
 allowed to compose novel melodies. The overall results cast doubt on
 the promise of note--by--note prediction for composition.},

	Abstract = {Researchers wishing to create computational systems that
 themselves generate artworks face two interacting challenges. The
 first is that the standards by which artistic output is judged are
 notoriously difficult to quantify. The larger AI community is
 currently involved in a rich internal dialogue on methodological
 issues, standards, and rigor, and hence murkiness with regard to the
 assessment of output must be faced squarely. The second challenge is
 that any artwork exists within an extraordinarily rich cultural and
 historical context, and it is rare that an artist who is ignorant of
 this context will produce acceptable works. In this paper the authors
 assert that these considerations argue for case--based AI/Art systems
 that take critical criteria as parameters. They describe an example
 system that produces new bebop jazz melodies from a case--base of
 melodies, using genetic programming techniques and a fitness function
 based on user--provided critical criteria. They discuss the role that
 such techniques may play in future work on AI and the arts.},

@article{WittenManzaraEtAl94,
	Abstract = {The information content of each successive note in a piece
 of music is not an intrinsic musical property but depends on the
 listener's own model of a genre of music. Human listeners' models can
 be elicited by having them guess successive notes and assign
 probabilities to their guesses by gambling. Computational models can
 be constructed by developing a structural framework for prediction,
 and {"training"} the system by having it assimilate a corpus of sample
 compositions and adjust its internal probability estimates
 accordingly. These two modeling techniques turn out to yield
 remarkably similar values for the information content, or {"entropy,"}
 of the Bach chorale melodies. While previous research has
 concentrated on the overall information content of whole pieces of
 music, the present study evaluates and compares the two kinds of
 model in fine detail. Their predictions for two particular chorale
 melodies are analyzed on a note--by--note basis, and the smoothed
 information profiles of the chorales are examined and compared.
 Apart from the intrinsic interest of comparing human with
 computational models of music, several conclusions are drawn for the
 improvement of computational models.},

@incollection{Elman95,
	Abstract = {Obviously, there are substantial differences between
 brains and kidneys, just as there are between kidneys and hearts and
 the skin. It would be silly to minimze these differences. On the
 other hand, a cautionary note is also in order. The domains over
 which the various organs operate are quite different, but their
 common biological substrate is quite similar. The brain is indeed
 quite remarkable, and does some things which are very similar to
 human--made symbol processors; but there are also profound differences
 between the brain and digital symbol processors, and attempts to
 ignore these on grounds of simplification or abstraction run the risk
 of fundamentally misunderstanding the nature of neural computation.
 In a larger sense, I raise the more general warning that ``cognition
 may not be what we think it is''. Among other things, I will suggest
 in this chapter that language (and cognition in general) may be more
 usefully understood as the behavior of a dynamical system. I believe
 this is a view which both acknowledges the similarity of the brain to
 other bodily organs and respects the evolutionary history of the
 nervous system, while also acknowledging the very remarkable
 properties possessed by the brain. In the view I will outline,
 representations are not abstract symbols but rather regions of state
 space. Rules are not operations on symbols but rather embedded in the
 dynamics of the system, a dynamics which permits movement from
 certain regions to others while making other transitions
 difficult. Let me emphasize from the beginning that I am not arguing
 that language behavior is not rule--governed. Instead, I suggest that
 the nature of the rules may be different than what we have conceived
 them to be.},

@article{Hendel95,
	Abstract = {A study of the teaching behaviour of 9 excellent
		elementary music teachers.  Thorough methodology.  Bit waffly.
	Previous research on music education has identified three
	dimensions of behaviour of good music teachers:
		magnitude (Yarbrough) - ability to change behaviour
		  dramatically at 'precisely the right moment'.
		  Behaviour measured as body movement, gestures,
		  voice, facial expression, eye contact, speed, ...
		sequential patterns of instruction (Yarborough & Price)
		  presentation, response, reinforcement - observed in
		  all kinds of music instruction
		intensity (Madsen and Geringer) - traits commonly
		  associated with good teachers: with-it-ness,
		  overlap, expertise, magnitude, enthusiasm, teacher affect
		  Formal definition: {"a global attribute that is used
		  to describe sustained control of the student/teacher
		  interaction, evidenced by efficient, accurate
		  presentation and correction of the subject matter"} (Madsen)
	Previous research - presentation approx 50% of class time.
	   - time on task should be varied and presented in short segments
	   - more experienced teachers gave fewer directions
           - students and teachers rate academic musical information
	     as best kind of presentation
	   - reinforcement - high approval improves attentiveness,
	     lessens inappropriate behaviour, and had a positive
	     influence on students' attitudes towards music.
           - contingent reinforcement (?) can produce more accurate
	     intonation
           - reinforcement ending with approval is preferred
           - some waffle about content and timing requiring knowledge
	     of subject matter, and of students
	Observed and recorded lessons, video and audio tapes,
	interviews with the teachers, and with a selection of their students,
	chosen to represent categories including onn/off-task, different
	levels of enthusiasm.
	Produced and expanded set of sequencing patterns:
	   - 1,2,3; 1,2,1,2,3; repeated 1,2 followed by 3; no
	     reinforcement; no presentation; ...
	   - used at different stages in the lesson.  eg start of
	     lesson might need no reinforcement.  Give names to the
	     different patterns.
	Qualitative results: teachers had individual styles but also
	common instructional behaviours, and personal values.
        Used clearly defined goals, objectives and classroom procedures.
	Highly flexible reactions, adjusting pacing.
	Students described these teachers as 'fun'.  They preferred
	singing, playing instruments and movement activities.
	Enthusiasm and positive attitude (and feedback) were also
	cited as teacher attributes the students noticed.
	Quantitative results:
		- did timings of teachers, looking at magnitude factors.
		- 54% class time teacher (presenting and reinforcing
		  academic content), 46% students (about half spent
		  performing)
		- all were highly approving and gave specific feedback
		- basic instructional pattern (123) 53% of the time
		- patterns 123 and 12123 - 74%
		- patterns 123, 12123 and {12}*3 - 89%
		- methods: identification of musical elements, drill,
		  ear training (in 80% of classes), sight-reading,
		  echo-clapping or body percussion, vocal modelling,
		  discussion, accompanying, discovery or
		  experimentation, cross-curricular integration.
		- also looked at materials and teaching tools used.
	Results largely supported work on magnitude, extended sequential
	patterns.  Disapproval largely expe=ressed facially rather
	then verbally.  Approval more verbal.  More feedback than
	observed in previous studies.  Didn't really look at intensity.},

	Abstract = {Addresses the problem of musical variation (identification
 of different musical sequences as variations) and its implications
 for mental representations of music. According to reductionist
 theories, listeners judge the structural importance of musical events
 while forming mental representations. These judgments may result from
 the production of reduced memory representations that retain only the
 musical gist. In a study of improvised music performance, pianists
 produced variations on melodies. Analyses of the musical events
 retained across variations provided support for the reductionist
 account of structural importance. A neural network trained to produce
 reduced memory representations for the same melodies represented
 structurally important events more efficiently than others. Agreement
 among the musicians' improvisations, the network model, and
 music--theoretic predictions suggest that perceived constancy across
 musical variation is a natural result of a reductionist mechanism for
 producing memory representations.},

@article{Major95,
	Abstract = {A language for representing teaching strategies for use by
                  teachers within COCA authoring tool for ITS. A COCA
                  strategy is:
                      - responsible for choosing part of the domain to
                  teach
                      - whether taught, tested or summarised
                      - what style of interaction
                      - which aspect to focus on
                      - how to handle student's response to testing
            Teachers never made a complete strategy change in one go -
                  would be in little steps.
            COCA has separate knowledge bases and interpreter for
                  strategies, meta-strategies and the domain itself.
                  Domain knowledge is structured in frames which have
                  user defined values and attributes.  (Object
                  oriented approach).  Organised hierarchically.
            The student model
                      - stores a student rating: low, average, high,
                      - the rating is changed on the basis of test
                  results
                      - teacher can choose no of right answers before
                  increasing the rating, n. wrong before decreasing
                  it, and the number of points added and deducted for
                  right answers.  (points are used purely for student
                  motivation.)
                      - has a record of the interaction history.  Can
                  be consulted to see what has been taught, tested,
                  and test outcomes.  So can say whether student knows
                  something.  Like an overlay model.
            The teaching strategy knowledge: 4 decisions:
                  1. Concept to consider next
                       - could look for untaught, next, harder,
                         easier, let student decide.
                  2. Tutorial activity and style
                       - teach (presentation, analogy, demo)
                       - test (multi-choice, fill-in-blank,
                               categorisation, graphical test)
                       - summarise
                  3. Content of next interaction (attribute to use)
                  4. Response to testing (whether to give hints,
                     interrupt, ...)
                  Each decision is influenced by the preceeding ones.
            Meta-Strategic knowledge - when to use which teaching
                  strategy.  Can ignore or use certain rules.  Change
                  set of rules in use for one of the 4 strategic
                  decisions.
            Evaluation details follow - some teachers had trouble with
                  using the metalevel, others didn't.  Generally a
                  positive response.},

	Dannenberg (84) and Vercoe (84) were the first in this area.
	Basically pitch matching for Dannenberg.  Vercoe used a least cost
		approach which scored different interpretations, using pitch

		lowest cost.  Used statistical learning techniques so their
		system could rehearse with a musician and learn things like
		tempo deviations.
	Following them, Baird, Blevins and Zahler produced 'the artificially
		intelligent computer performer'  Uses segments instead of
		individual events.  Segments are classified as:
		verbatim - exact(ish) match
		amalgamated - incorrect note, corrected without disturbing
			overall tempo
		held-through - an event was deleted without losing time
		rest - deletion of a rest that doesn't affect rhythm, eg
			lengthening a note.
	ICRAM Follower - Puckette and Lippe - purely pitch based.  Limited.

		Same representation for performance and score.
		Uses onset times, resorting to pitch info if that fails.
		Onsets represented in seconds and wrt score/tempo
		Stores expected tempo, and a set of 7 current/recent tempi,
			these are weighted and used in predicting/setting the
			next onset time.
		For each new event, calculates time difference between it and
			previous event.  If less than a threshold, assumes
			events are intended to happen at the same time (eg
			chord), otherwise, it's a separate event.  If the
			event deviates from the expected time of the next
			event by more than a threshold ('window of belief'), a
			pitch matching algorithm is called, otherwise the
			tempo is recomputed.
		Pitch matching is based on Dannenberg's approach},

@incollection{Barrett96,
	Abstract = {Looks at theories of language acquisition which emphasise
		that learning is what the brain does naturally, rather
		than learning being something that has to be provoked.
	    Factors in the development of verbal skills are:
		immersion, demonstration, engagement, expectations,
		responsibility, approximation, use, response.
	    Some believe these are a framework for learning in
		general.  Here they are applied to music education:
	    immersion - expose kids to appropriate sound-making
		materials - real ones rather than bottles full of
		pebbles. Provide lots of quality examples of different
		kinds of music.
	    demonstration - models of behaviours from which we learn.
		Kids should be able to see others doing listening,
		performance and composition, and also talking about
		music.
	    engagement - kids need to percieve themselves as potential
		doers of whatever is being demonstrated, and to have
		confidence that they can produce something which will
		be accepted. Need to want to acquire the skills.
	    expectations - in language, kids are expected to succeed.
		Should be same in music.  Teachers should show
		confidence in child's abilities.
	    responsibility - kids need opportunities to operate
		independently and assess their own solutions.  Teacher
		should introduce open-ended challenges of increasing
		difficulty. Peer tutoring and expert advice are
		important.
	    approximation - in language, infants' first attempts are
		rewarded no matter how far they are from the ideal
		response.  The 'have a go' attitude.  Start with a
		weak approximation and gradually improve it.
		'Mistakes' are a vital part of the process.
	    use - learner needs to put skills into practice, and
		evaluate their experiences.
	    response - learners need feedback from experts.  Should be
		relevant, appropriately timed, readily available and
		non-threatening.  Variety of forms: acceptance of
		learner's approximation, celebration of learner's
		attempt and the effort they made, evaluation of how
		good the approximation was, or a demonstration of
		other possibilities, and maybe a more refined
		approximation.},

@article{Deliege96,
	Abstract = {This research will attempt to apply the principles of categorisation set forth by Rosch in the area of semantic and conceptual representation to the processes of music listening. Results obtained in previous studies on segmentation of entire pieces have tended to suggest the existence of a cue abstraction process, that is, the identification of invariance between cues determining the high level groupings. Within the principle of verticality proposed by Rosch, cues can thus be regarded as operating at the basic level, while groups can be regarded as constituting a higher hierarchically level of structure or superordinal level. Altematively, all the variations of cue structures encountered in a musical composition could be conceived of as functioning at a subordinate level (taking into account Rosch's principle of horizontality). The research reported here is based on this latter alternative. Four different paradigms were used within the framework of one experiment in order to explore the viability of cue abstraction processes during listening. The four tasks required of the subjects were the evaluation of the frequency of occurrence of motifs, their classification into families on the basis of abstracted cues and on the basis of components of those cues, and evaluation of degrees of similarity between motifs.

 whose frequencies match periodicities in the input tend to become
 activated. Metrical structure is represented explicitly in the
 network in the form of clusters of os--cillators whose frequencies and
 phase angles are constrained to maintain the harmonic relationships
 that characterize meter. Rests in rhythmic patterns are represented
 by ex--plicit rest oscillators in the network, which become activated
 when an expected beat in the pattern fails to appear. The model makes
 predictions about the relative difficulty of patterns and the effect
 of deviations from periodicity in the input.},

	    Little point in designing teaching methods without any

		driven.  Cognitive, social and affective aspects of

            Development of melodic perception: global to analytic
		strategies. Movement from gross to precise features.
	    Often explanations are in terms of schemas (including
		Piagetian theories).  Niesser (1976) described them as
		{"cognitive structures that prepare the perciever to
		accept certain kinds of information rather than
		others."}
	    Cognitive-developmental psychology - most applicable to
		music education.  Largely applications of Piaget's
		theory. Doubts about this, because time-dependency of
		music makes it difficult to produce musical analogues
		of Piaget's materials, in which objects for comparison
		were presented simultaneously.
	    Various theories of musical appreciation: immature to
		mature (more formal), pre-symbolic and symbolic.
	    Behavioural psychology - easily applied to teaching and
		much used in the States: competency-based approach.
		Effective in the teaching of lower level performance

@article{Jacob96,
	Abstract = {There are two distinct types of creativity: the flash out
 of the blue (inspiration? genius?), and the process of incremental
 revisions (hard work). Not only are we years away from modeling the
 former, we do not even begin to understand it. The latter is
 algorithmic in nature and has been modeled in many systems both
 musical and non--musical. Algorithmic composition is as old as music
 composition. It is often considered a cheat, a way out when the
 composer needs material and/or inspiration. It can also be thought of
 as a compositional tool that simply makes the composer's work go
 faster. This article makes a case for algorithmic composition as such
 a tool. The `hard work' type of creativity often involves trying many
 different combinations against each other and choosing one over
 others. This iterative task seems natural to be expressed as a
 computer algorithm. The implementation issues can be reduced to two
 components: how to understand one's own creative process well enough
 to reproduce it as an algorithm, and how to program a computer to
 differentiate between `good' and `bad' music. The philosophical
 issues reduce to the question who or what is responsible for the
 music produced?},

@article{Major96,
	Abstract = {Teachers currently tend to use musical concepts, elements
	and devices as a basic for choosing activities, and grouping
	activities.  This practice is influenced by the assessment
	requirements of the National Curriculum, focussed on producing
	measurable, assessable outcomes - concept acquisition is relatively
 	easy to measure, compared to the skills and attitudes also mentioned
	as part of the curriculum.
Children have to experience music in order to gain the knowledge
	required.  The National Curriculum makes concepts central to musical
	learning.  There is a need for greater skill learning.  Problem is
	little time within the classroom, and students who are not learning to
	play an instrument outside classroom music time do not have much time
	to pick up the necessary skills.
{"I have found, however, that after a period of time their use and
	identification across a unit of work can detract from the musical
	nature of composing and performing, and that progress can become
	stilted rather than enhanced."}  (about focus on concepts) p186
	See Regelski, BJME, 3, 2, 185-6 for more criticism of concept learning
	in music ed.  He says that teachers look for activities for teaching
	concepts that the children will enjoy, but in time, many of these
	come to be regarded as pointless by the children, perhaps because
	they have led to very little tangible skill learning
Keith Swanwick also agrees: working from and to concepts can diminish
	prospects for musical encounters in classrooms, {"as though music was
	merely an illustration of something else".} (88, Music, Mind and
	Education)
Plummeridge - it is HOW children learn things that is important.
	Music education would probably be much more effective if the teaching
	of skills was carried out in a more ordered and structured manner
Her main recommendation seems to be that more time should be spent on
	learning to play an instrument, while not excluding composition and
	concept learning.  Should concentrate on posing problems for students
	to solve, where solution requires imagination and skill, and promotes
	motivation to understand concepts.},

	Abstract = {Lots of research this century, esp. in last 30 years on
		children's musical perception abilities.  More
		recently also a school looking at development of
		children's musical activities (singing, composing, ...).
	    Pitch discrimination research: children can perceive very
		small intervals (average 7-year old can discriminate
		within 1/6 semitone (1% difference in frequency).
		Discrimination improves with age, and individual
		differences are large.
	    Relevance to class teachers:  teaching pitch (up/down) -
		some kids can discriminate but the up/down labelling
		needs explaining/teaching.  Some kids have better
		discrimination than some teachers.  Diagnosing musical
		problems in perception not easy, since child has to DO
		something to demonstrate correct perception, and
		problem may be in the demonstration rather than the
		perception itself.  Need to set realistic expectations
		for children, and not set them too low.
	    Children as musicians:
	    1. Sequential development as composers.
		Swanwick/Tillman's spiral model of development.  Based
		on several hundred compositions by 48 children.  Could
		also be used to explain someone's reactions of first
		hearing a new musical style: incomprehension, concern
		with sound qualities themselves, then their shapes and
		colours, the getting inside the structure enough to
		become surprised when it something happens.
		Generalisation of course - doesn't fit every child (ar
		perhaps any child) exactly.
	    2. Song composition.
		Davies - focus on differences rather than
		similarities.  20 songs composed by children of
		different ages. Describes what the kids did and argues
		that it is impossible to produce a single progressive
		music curriculum to suit all children.
	    3. Singing in tune
		Buckton (1988) New Zealand study recorded children as
		they sang with a class.  1135 children.  Boys less
		able than girls.  Polynesian children significantly
		better than European background, and with less gender
		difference. Therefore methods from different
		situations may not be transferrable. The Polynesian
		kids had less formal music training at school, but
		grew up doing more singing.
	    A mixed-ability approach to music teaching is essential.},

@article{Butler97,
	Abstract = {Quotes Cook as saying that theories of music and of
		musical perception are fundamentally different, the
		former being about analysis from a particular
		viewpoint, and the latter about listening.  Also
		quotes two studies in which listeners' reactions
		contradict established theories about pitch
		relationships.
	    There has been very little transfer of music perception
		research into the college music community.
		(Exceptions are Steve Larson and Gary Karpinski)
	    Even the music teaching journals don't take it on board -
		they are mainly concerned with subtleties of delivering
		the traditional drill-and-tests, sight singing and
		dictation.  There is counter evidence suggesting that
		these aren't the best teaching methods.
	    Has been visiting top music colleges to see what their
		aural training practices are.  Found a general lack of
		focussed educational objectives in aural training.
		There seem to be 2 broad schools of thought:
		Mainstream: Aim to develop the 'inner ear' - good
			relative pitch and a solid sense of tonality.
			Classroom activities mainly sight singing and
			dictation. {"Aural training is the means,
			intelligent musical performance is the end".}
		Secondary: Aim to co-develop aural mastery and
			performance skill.  The two viewed as
			inseperable, but for different reasons.  As a
			result, classroom activities vary widely.
			{"performance is the means, aural training is
			the end".}
		Both believe in close link between aural skills and
		performance.  Both have shifted towards the use of
		musically realistic examples, and away from things
		like isolated intervals.
	    Use of unrealistic stimuli is one reason why music
		cognition research is often not considered relevant.
	    At most schools, aural training is handed down,
		essentially intact, between generations.
	    Aural training in American colleges is still a pastiche of
		observable behaviours that may or may not link to a
		set of aural skills. We don't know how (if) they map.
	    We can't assess whether current methods are the most
		effective without having more of a general perceptual
		theory of music.
	    Suspects that such a theory will have at its core an
		unbreakable link between performance and listening
		skills.   Many famous music educators have recognised
		that physical motion (or position) and musical motion
		can be linked to sharpen mental imagery of music.  You
		cannot perform what you cannot internally hear, but
		also, you cannot internally hear what you cannot
		concieve of performing.
	    Performance and listening can be related through physical
		motion. More research is needed to investigate this
		connection. },

@inproceedings{DesainHoningEtAl97,
	Abstract = {Describes three algorithms for score matching.  Generally
	written to do real-time score following for automatic accompaniment
	systems, or for expression editors and music analysis (often required
	to capture expressive differences between a performance and a score).
	In general, the matching problem is made difficult by features
		such as parallel voices, performance errors and
		variations, events like glissando, trill, ...
	Typical errors in musical performance: addition, deletion,
		substitution. Most matchers just work in terms of
		additions and deletions.
	Most algorithms primarily match pitch, some also use time
		info.  Vantomme uses time, resorting to pitch when
		this fails.
 	3 algorithms presented all use temporal info to some extent:
	1. Strict Matcher (from authors' POCO environment).
		V. simple.  Incremental.  Uses a window, strict
		ordering on notes.  Does well with expert performances.
		Fails on errors in context of many repeated notes, or
		where order in score is not respected. Complexity is
		linear in no of notes in the performance.
	2. Tabular Matcher (Large, Hoshishiba et al)
		Constructs a table which ranks all possible matches
		between clusters of notes in the score and performance.
		Need a good measure of 'goodness of match'.  Dynamic
		programming approach. Complexity - order NClusters
		squared times nNotes.  But could improve by just
		looking at the diagonal band in the table - clusters
		close to each other in time.  Handles errors better
		than strict matcher, and can match notes with
		different pitches.
	3. Structural Matcher (Heijink 96)
		Uses temporal structure - eg notes in same melodic
		line will have order preserved, while order may vary
		between notes in different lines.  Uses structural
		annotation of the score - objects are either
		sequential (eg melody) or parallel (eg chord).  Whole
		score is represented as a tree, where nodes are S/P
		objects, or notes.  Performance is just a list of
		notes with onset times.  Matcher tries to predict
		onset time of next note, based on previous matches,
		and structural info.  Then places a window over that
		point in the performance and matches according to
		pitch (maintains multiple possible matches where there
		is > 1 note of required pitch).  Chooses between
		multiple matches using a 'goodness of fit' score.},

No difference between computer presentation and in-class lecture

Expt 1: Control group used a computer-based
	drill and practice program which had no instruction or assistance, and
	also did homework exercises for topics that program didn't cover.
	Control group spent much more time on in-class discussion.  Treatment
	spent much more on the computer, and 1000 vs 600 minutes overall. (but
	control times excludes 6 homework assignments)
Expt 2: Control group used class, book-based learning.  No computers.
	Treatment group used MusiCard for 1 hour per week for 10 weeks
	(actual time not measured, and problems with computer downtime).
	Instructors for treatment group spent on average 136 minutes less on
	theory, compared to total (average) of 616 for control group.  Didn't

@article{SaffranNewportEtAl97,
	Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the performance of first-grade children and adults on an incidental language-learning task. Learning entailed word segmentation from continuous speech, an initial and crucial component of language acquisition. Subjects were briefly exposed to an unsegmented artificial language, presented auditorily, in which the only cues to word boundaries were the transitional probabilities between syllables. Subjects were not told that they were listening to a language, or even to listen at all; rather, they were engaged in a cover task of creating computer illustrations. Both adults and children learned the words of the language. Moreover, the children performed as well as the adults. These data suggest that a statistical learning mechanism (transitional probability computation) is able to operate incidentally and, surprisingly, as well in children as in adults.},

	Abstract = {Communication signals in many animal species (including
 humans) show a surprising amount of variety both across time and at
 any one instant in a population. Traditional accounts and simulation
 models of the evolution of communication offer little explanation of
 this diversity. Sexual selection of signals used to attract mates,
 and the coevolving preferences used to judge those signals, can
 instead provide a convincing mechanism. Here we demonstrate that a
 wide variety of ``songs'' can evolve when male organisms sing their
 songs to females who judge each male's output and decide whether or
 not to mate with him based on their own coevolved aesthetics. Evolved
 variety and rate of innovation are greatest when females combine
 inherited song preferences with a desire to be surprised. If females
 choose mates from a small pool of candidates, diversity and rate of
 change are also increased. Such diversity of communication signals
 may have implications for the evolution of brains as well.},

	Abstract = {Interfaces need to adapt to different users, platforms and
	interaction styles.  Their concept is 'user interfaces for all',
	following 'design for all' and 'universal accessibility'.  Underlying
	objective is to take into account the preferences, abilities and
	requirements of user population at large, including disabled and
	elderly people.  Use results from adaptive systems, model-based
	interface design (design an interface from a collection of reusable
	models and knowledge repositories) and agent-based interaction.  These
	areas have tended to look only at average user.  Disabled users have
	needed adaptations.  But these are only a temporary fix - new
	technologies reintroduce old problems.
Their framework is 'unified user interface development' - a
	development framework allowing interfaces development to be
	independent of user profile, platfrom or interaction metaphor.  They
	have developed tools.
A 'unified interface' consists of a single interface implementation,
	appropriate for all users.  No direct calls to underlying platform,
	uses tools to connect with platform in an independent manner.  Can be
	tailored.  Has alternative dialog patterns, grouped on the basis of an
	abstraction model.  Abstract dialog mapped onto physical one at
	runtime.
Needs runtime resources, libraries, knowledge about user and platform,
	and utilisation of tools for constructing the interface in the
	first place.
Notes: makes it sound like a lot of work if can't use their tools.
	Very abstract.  How does this work in practice?},

	Abstract = {The General Computational Theory of Musical Structure
 (GCTMS) is a theory that may be employed to obtain a structural
 description (or set of descriptions) of a musical surface. This
 theory is based on general cognitive and logical principles, is
 independent of any specific musical style or idiom, and can be
 applied to any musical surface.  The musical work is presented to
 GCTMS as a sequence of discrete symbolically represented events
 (e.g. notes) without higher--level structural elements
 (e.g. articulation marks, time--signature etc.) -- although such
 information may be used to guide the analytic process.  The aim of
 the application of the theory is to reach a structural description of
 the musical work that may be considered as 'plausible' or
 'permissible' by a human music analyst. As style--dependent knowledge
 is not embodied in the general theory, highly sophisticated analyses
 (similar to those an expert analyst may provide) are not expected.
 The theory gives, however, higher rating to descriptions that may be
 considered more reasonable or acceptable by human analysts and lower
 to descriptions that are less plausible.  The analytic descriptions
 given by GCTMS may be said to relate to and may be compared with the
 intuitive 'understanding' a listener has when repeatedly exposed to a
 specific musical work. Although the theory does not make any claim of
 simulating cognitive processes as these are realised in the mind, it
 does give insights into the intrinsic requirements of musical
 analytic tasks and its results may be examined with respect to
 cognitive validity.  The proposed theory comprises two distinct but
 closely related stages of development: a) the development of a number
 of individual components that focus on specialised musical analytic
 tasks, and b) the development of an elaborate account of how these
 components relate to and interact with each other so that plausible
 structural descriptions of a given musical surface may be arrived at.
 A prototype computer system based on the GCTMS has been
 implemented. As a test case, the theory and prototype system have
 been applied on various melodic surfaces from the 12--tone
 equal--temperament system.},

	Abstract = {Does the music that we know have a language--like
 semantics? I argue that mere agreement among auditors about their
 cognitive representations and descriptions of music doesn't give
 grounds for attributing meaning to music. I also argue that music
 does not have a language--like semantics not because it fails to be
 robustly referential, but because musical structures are not genuine
 grammars. The reason is that while music typically has very elaborate
 and regular structures -- much like language -- these structures do not
 apparently originate from nor are they in the service of the need to
 encode meanings -- exactly unlike language. Nonetheless, the
 difference between languages and music is more a matter of degree
 than of kind. In other words, we can imagine transforming what we now
 call music into a language; if, by some strange necessity, music were
 pressed into service on a day--to day basis for the purposes of
 comprehension and communication, then it could without much trouble
 become a language. But we would very likely no longer regard the
 strangely melodious utterances of such a language to be real music
 once it came to serve, in a quite transparent way, its pragmatic
 communicative and cognitive functions. I explain these views as a
 consequence of an old--fashioned aesthetic theory of music cognition
 as newly formulated by Raffman (1993).},

 music is a rather new, exciting research area bringing together
 different disciplines such as computer science, musicology,
 mathematics and cognitive science. One of its objectives is to
 develop neural network models which are able to learn from music
 compositions structure elements characterizing the personal style of
 a composer. This has been a starting point of research activities at
 our institute during the last years. The impression has resulted that
 artificial neural networks, when carefully developed, are sensitive,
 powerful, and innovative tools if capturing the specificity of a
 certain composer's style is intended.},

@inproceedings{JohansonPoli98,
	Abstract = { In this paper we present the GP--Music System, an
 interactive system which allows users to evolve short musical
 sequences using interactive genetic programming, and its extensions
 aimed at making the system fully automated. The basic GP--system works
 by using a genetic programming algorithm, a small set of functions
 for creating musical sequences, and a user interface which allows the
 user to rate individual sequences. With this user interactive
 technique it was possible to generate pleasant tunes over runs of 20
 individuals over 10 generations. As the user is the bottleneck in
 interactive systems, the system takes rating data from a users run
 and uses it to train a neural network based automatic rater, or {"auto
 rater"}, which can replace the user in bigger runs. Using this auto
 rater we were able to make runs of up to 50 generations with 500
 individuals per generation. The best of run pieces generated by the
 auto raters were pleasant but were not, in general, as nice as those
 generated in user interactive runs.},

 meaning in music. I propose that it is a mistake to import the

 different nature from linguistic communication, and that there is no
 evidence to support the suggestion that the two should function in a
 strongly similar way.},

@article{Baroni99,
	Abstract = {The concept of {"grammar"} is at the basis both of listening
 to and of composing music. Music grammar includes morphology and
 syntax, the former being defined as the identification of different
 categories of musical structures, the latter as that of rules
 connecting morphological unities. In listening to music morphology
 corresponds to {"categorical"} perception and syntax to {"structural"}
 perception. In composing and in music analysis, the intuitive
 procedures of perception must be transformed into explicitly rational
 knowledge: morphology corresponds to a clear definition of musical
 concepts and syntax to that of musical rules. According to the
 theory, morphology and syntax correspond to actual cognitive
 processes; however a distinction is made between a grammar, and its
 uses, that is, its applications in composing and listening
 activities. Some critical remarks on this point are made in respect
 of the tradition of cognitive studies. A further aspect of grammar is
 then underlined: the distintion between syntactic and semantic
 rules. The aim of both of these is to build expressive structures
 which can be undestood and interpreted by means of socially
 legitimated hermeneutic conventions. In this sense grammar is to be
 conceived of not only as a psychic, but also as a social
 instrument. In order to understand the mental procedures of
 composition, all the methods so far proposed risk remaining at the
 surface of the problems to which they are applied unless they are
 integrated into a more accurate and adequate consideration of
 grammatical thinking.},

 genetic algorithm (IGA) that models a jazz improviser and performs as
 a featured soloist in the author's virtual quintet. GenJam evolves
 populations of melodic ideas under the guidance of a human mentor,
 whose feedback provides the environment under which individual ideas
 either survive to breed or die off. GenJam also uses its genetic
 algorithm machinery as a real--time melodic development paradigm to
 evolve phrases played by a human into its improvised responses in
 chase choruses. The paper provides an overview of the GenJam
 architecture and focuses on interface issues for three classes of
 users: mentors who train GenJam individually, audiences who train
 GenJam collectively, and performers who interact with GenJam in
 real--time performance situations.},

 then extract some common notions about the interestingness of
 conjectures and concepts. We detail how empirical evidence is used to
 give plausibility to conjectures, and the different ways in which a
 concept or conjecture can be thought of as novel. We also detail how
 programs assess how surprising and complex a conjecture statement is,

 which artificial intelligence has been able to explain aspects of the
 nature of our musical experience. It will start by posing the
 question {"What is that happens when we experience a piece of music?"},
 and will describe the ways in which research that has been carried
 out over the last thirty years can successfully explain why we
 experience what we experience in listening to music. However, this
 success is relative, and the paper will conclude by examining some of
 the challenges that music poses for artificial intelligence.},

	Abstract = {In this chapter I shall attempt to offer an alternative
 account of the role of music in human evolution. At the outset I must
 admit that it is in part motivated by a personal desire to defend the
 value of music as a human activity -- as a musician, the notion of
 music as {"parasitic cheesecake"} is somewhat unpalatable. But it is
 also motivated by a desire to try to make sense of the varieties of
 music, of the multiplicities of roles that music plays in human lives
 and of the myriad and divergent meanings that have been attributed to
 music. In this attempt I shall be putting forward a view of music as
 rooted in human biology and its evolution, but one that is not
 intended to be reductionist or simply sociobiological. I shall not be
 arguing that there is a {"gene for music"}, but rather that our
 musicality is grounded in human biology as expressed in the evolution
 and development of our cognitive capacities and of our social and
 environmental interactions. Music is a product of, and a process in,
 our individual development, the cultures that enfold our
 {"lifelines"}[4] and the evolution of our species.},

 both music and some examples of speech production is meter. Yet
 detailed measurements of the timing of both music and speech show
 that the nested periodicities that define metrical structure can be
 quite noisy in time. What kind of system could produce or perceive
 such variable metrical timing patterns?  And what would it take to be
 able to store and reproduce particular metrical patterns from
 long--term memory? We have developed a network of coupled oscillators
 that both produces and perceives patterns of pulses that conform to
 particular meters. In addition, beginning with an initial state with
 no biases, it can learn to prefer the particular meter that it has
 been previously exposed to.},

@inproceedings{IrvineCantwellEtAl99,
	Abstract = {This paper argues that creativity has a cognitive base,
 and as such it incorporates metacognitive, motivational and
 self--regulation components. We therefore conceptualise creativity as
 emerging from a notion of expertise grounded in more sophisticated
 accounts of cognition and content. The distinguishing feature of the
 expert is their ability to creatively solve problems. On the basis of
 this account, composition is seen as evidence for an increasing level
 of expertise which involves increasing levels of abstraction in the
 cognitive base and consequent sophistication in the strategic way
 that composers engage in the composition process. The paper then
 critically reviews existing account of musical creativity from the
 stand point of the need to incorporate underlying cognitive basis to
 creative musical activity. This is demonstrated through analysis of
 research literature of composition.},

@article{KrumhanslLouhivuoriEtAl99,
	Abstract = {This article is a study of Finnish spiritual folk hymns,
 combining three different approaches to understanding melodic
 expectancy. The first is a behavioral experiment in which listeners
 made judgments about melodic continuations. Two groups of listeners
 participated. One had extensive experience with the style and was
 familiar with the particular hymns. The other consisted of musicians
 who were unfamiliar with the hymns. The second approach was a
 statistical style analysis of a representative corpus of 18
 hymns. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone
 onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. The third approach
 simulated melodic expectancy with neural network models of the
 self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen, 1997). One model was trained
 on the corpus of 18 hymns, while another was trained with only the
 materials used in the experiment. Comparing the results showed strong
 convergence between the three approaches. The correspondences found
 between the behavioral judgments and the statistical style analysis
 supports the idea that listeners are sensitive to the distributions
 of tones and tone combinations in music. The non-experts' responses
 more strongly reflected the general distribution of tones than the
 experts, whereas the experts' responses more strongly reflected the
 specific tone transitions. Correspondences between the behavioral
 judgments and the SOMs were also strong and showed effects of
 expertise. The non-experts' responses were modeled better with the
 SOM that had been trained on the 18 hymn corpus, whereas the experts'
 responses were modeled better with the SOM that had been trained on
 the experimental materials, thus simulating the process of
 recognizing the particular hymns. Finally, all three approaches gave
 support to the implication-realization model (Narmour, 1990) of
 musical expectancy. Moreover, the relative weighting of the
 principles was similar for behavioral, statistical, and computational
 measures.},

	Abstract = {We explore the application of statistical techniques,
 borrowed from natural language processing, to music. A probabilistic
 method is used to capture and generalise from the local harmonic
 movement of a corpus of senteenth--century dance music. The
 probabilistic grammars so generated are then used for experiments in
 generation (composition).  The corpus is preprocessed in a novel way,
 automatically converting the harmonies into a normal form to capture
 the underlying harmonic similarities between pieces. It is then
 automatically marked up with constituent boundaries (beginnings and
 ends of pieces, phrases and bars), to enable the learning process to
 capture some of the higher--level structure of the music.  The
 experiment is promising, and a sample of the results are given. We
 discuss the limitations of the approach, and how they might be
 overcome.},

 imbued with the rules of civilized human conduct, who could further
 learn how to behave and possibly even evolve through successive
 generations into a more perfect form. Modern human composers
 similarly strive to create intelligent algorithmic music composition
 systems that can follow prespecified rules, learn appropriate
 patterns from a collection of melodies, or evolve to produce output
 more perfectly matched to some aesthetic criteria. Here we review
 recent efforts aimed at each of these three types of algorithmic
 composition. We focus particularly on evolutionary methods, and
 indicate how monstrous many of the results have been. We present a
 new method that uses coevolution to create linked artificial music
 critics and music composers, and describe how this method can attach
 the separate parts of rules, learning, and evolution together into
 one coherent body.},

 composing music? Four approaches can be used: assessing 1) Product,
 2) Process, 3) Person, and 4) Environment. The purpose of the study
 was: 1) to give an overview of research studies in each of the four
 approaches, and 2) to suggest a Product--oriented method for assessing
 creativity in composing music and story--telling by children, which
 was successfully used with high interjudge reliabilties in Auh &
 Johnston (2000). The overview should give a clear picture of
 assessment methods for creativity in composing music. The overview
 shows that: 1) Product -- A most commonly used method for assessing
 music compositions is expert judges' evaluations using
 criteria. Computerized content analysis has been used for Western
 classical masterpieces. 2) Process -- Compositional strategies used by
 Expert vs. novice can be described as Gestaltistic vs. Atomistic. 3)
 Person -- Visual imagery stimulated by use of graphic notations in
 composing music made a significant difference in musical creativity,
 producing more creative compositions. 4) Environment -- Creativity in
 the East versus the West can be described as intuition
 vs. logic. Cross--cultural studies of musical creativity show that
 musicians of non--western countries emphasize aural skills,
 improvisation, and opportunity to exercise creative potentials.},

	Abstract = {Theory and research in visual imagery and creativity have
 shown that use of graphic notations could enhance creativity in
 composing music. However, no such study has been conducted with
 Australian students. The purpose of the study was to determine if
 composing music with graphic notations makes a significant difference
 in creativity in composing music when compared to composing music
 without graphic notations by Australian secondary school
 students. Subjects were 47 seventh--grade students (all male)
 attending a private school in Sydney, Australia. The students were
 divided into two equal groups of Experimental (n = 22) and Control (n
 = 25) group on the basis of their musical ability. The Experimental
 group received an instruction on how to use graphic notations for
 composing music, while the Control group did not. The students'
 compositions were videotape--recorded by the researcher for judges'
 evaluations. Four expert judges evaluated creativity of the
 compositions using 3 criteria, i.e. Being 1) Original, 2) Structured,
 and 3) Musical, and 5--point rating scales. The results showed that
 the Experimental group's creativity scores were significantly higher
 than the Control group's (p < .05). Therefore, the results confirmed
 the findings by Auh & Walker (1999) with Korean secondary school
 students in Korea. Implication: Teachers should use graphic notations
 to stimulate creative thinking in instructions on composing music.},

@incollection{Freeman00,
	Abstract = {Music is regarded in biological terms as originating in
 the brain, so that most explanations concentrate on the ways in which
 brains process information. Recent studies of the nonlinear dynamics
 of the primary sensory cortices have shown that the patterns that are
 constructed by chaotic nonlinear dynamics in cortical neuropil
 replace stimulus driven activity. This finding supports the concept
 that knowledge in brains is entirely constructed within them without
 direct transfer of information from outside. As knowledge increases
 by learning, brains of individuals grow progressively apart. The
 separation results from the uniqueness of the knowledge that is
 constructed within each brain. The resulting condition of isolation
 is known among philosophers as epistemological solipsism. This view
 is reinforced by the tenets of aesthetics, which emphasize the deeply
 personal experiences of individuals, not as active listeners but as
 passive recipients of beauty in music and other arts. Neither
 conventional neuroscience nor aesthetics can explain the deep
 emotional power of music to move humans to action.  An alternative
 view is presented, in which human brains are seen to have evolved
 primarily in response to environmental pressures to bridge the
 solipsistic gulf between individuals, and to form integrated
 societies. An evolutionary origin is found in the neurohumoral
 mechanisms of parental bonding to altricial infants. A case is made
 that music together with dance have co--evolved biologically and
 culturally to serve as a technology of social bonding. Findings of
 anthropologists and psychiatrists are reviewed to show how the
 rhythmic behavioral activities that are induced by drum beats and
 music can lead to altered states of consciousness, through which
 mutual trust among members of societies is engendered.},

	Abstract = {Only little systematic research has examined
 event--related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by the cognitive
 processing of music. The present study investigated how music
 processing is influenced by a preceding musical context, affected by
 the task relevance of unexpected chords, and influenced by the degree
 and the probability of violation. Four experiments were conducted in
 which {"nonmusicians"} listened to chord sequences, which infrequently
 contained a chord violating the sound expectancy of
 listeners. Integration of in--key chords into the musical context was
 reflected as a late negative--frontal deflection in the ERPs. This
 negative deflection declined towards the end of a chord sequence,
 reflecting normal buildup of musical context. Brain waves elicited by
 chords with unexpected notes revealed two ERP effects: an early
 right--hemispheric preponderant--anterior negativity, which was taken
 to reflect the violation of sound expectancy; and a late
 bilateral--frontal negativity. The late negativity was larger compared
 to in--key chords and taken to reflect the higher degree of
 integration needed for unexpected chords. The early right--anterior
 negativity (ERAN) was unaffected by the task relevance of unexpected
 chords. The amplitudes of both early and late negativities were found
 to be sensitive to the degree of musical expectancy induced by the
 preceding harmonic context, and to the probability for deviant
 acoustic events. The employed experimental design opens a new field
 for the investigation of music processing. Results strengthen the
 hypothesis of an implicit musical ability of the human brain.},

@article{KrumhanslToivanenEtAl00,
	Abstract = {This article is a study of melodic expectancy in North
 Sami yoiks, a style of music quite distinct from Western tonal
 music. Three different approaches were taken. The first approach was
 a statistical style analysis of tones in a representative corpus of
 18 yoiks. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone
 onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. It also identified style
 characteristics, such as pentatonic orientation, the presence of two
 reference pitches, the frequency of large consonant intervals, and a
 relatively large set of possible melodic continuations. The second
 approach was a behavioral experiment in which listeners made
 judgments about melodic continuations. Three groups of listeners
 participated. One group was from the Sami culture, the second group
 consisted of Finnish music students who had learned some yoiks, and
 the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar with
 yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations
 (for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on
 general style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks
 was found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical
 culture. The third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural
 network models of the self-organizing map (SOM) type (Kohonen,
 T. (1997). Self-organizing maps (2nd ed.). Berlin: Springer).  One
 model was trained on the excerpts of yoiks used in the behavioral
 experiment including the correct continuation tone, while another was
 trained with a set of Finnish folk songs and Lutheran hymns. The
 convergence of the three approaches showed that both listeners and
 the SOM model are influenced by the statistical distributions of
 tones and tone sequences. The listeners and SOM models also provided
 evidence supporting a core set of psychological principles underlying
 melody formation whose relative weights appear to differ across
 musical styles.},

 infants' early acquisition of information about their native language.
 The data show that infants perceptually ``map'' critical aspects of
 ambient language in the first year of life before they can speak.
 Statistical properties of speech are picked up through exposure to
 ambient language. Moreover, linguistic experience alters infants'
 perception of speech, warping perception in the service of language.
 Infants' strategies are unexpected and unpredicted by historical
 views. A new theoretical position has emerged, and six postulates of
 this position are described.},

 aid to musical composition: a system that would generate a (user
 specified) number of drum patterns, within a specified style and
 showing a sufficient amount of variation, on any one run. To achieve
 these aims a genetic algorithm was implemented using as its critic a
 multi--layer perceptron, trained on a set of {"drum&bass"}
 patterns. Domain specifiic knowledge was incorporated into a number
 of areas of the GA and an island model was used to generate multiple
 solutions. Experiments conducted, using human subjects, questioned
 the aesthetic merit and style of the generated patterns. These
 partial failures of the system to acheive the stated aims were
 attributed to shortcomings of the data used to train the ANN
 critic. Suggestions for future research have been presented in terms
 of improving the critic, extending the approach to more complicated
 rhythmic sequences and better evaluation of machine compositions.},

 melodies is shaped by certain melodic {"archetypes."} Among these
 archetypes is {"gap-fill,"} a name for melodies in which an early skip
 is followed by some of the pitches that have been skipped over. In
 experiments conducted with Rosner, Meyer sought to show that the
 gap-fill archetype can help explain the ways that listeners compare
 and classify melodies (Rosner & Meyer, 1982, 1986).  Reanalyses of
 the experimental results, however, suggest that gap-fill played
 little or no role. Together with an earlier study suggesting that
 gap-fill has no effect on melodic shape (von Hippel & Huron, 2000),
 these reanalyses weaken the claim that gap-fill is an important
 concept for classifying melodies.},

	Abstract = {In melodies from a wide variety of cultures, a large
 pitch interval tends to be followed by a change of direction.
 Although this tendency is often attributed to listeners'
 expectations, it might arise more simply from constraints on melodic
 ranginess or tessitura. Skips tend toward the extremes of a melody's
 tessitura, and from those extremes a melody has little choice but to
 retreat by changing direction. Statistical analyses of vocal melodies
 from four different continents are consistent with this simple
 explanation. The results suggest that, in the sampled repertories,
 patterns such as {"gap- fill,"} {"registral direction,"} and {"registral
 return"} (Meyer, 1956, 1973; Narmour, 1990) are mere side effects of
 constraints on melodic tessitura.},

 an example of a substantial and highly non--trivial application of
 machine learning to a musical problem. The basic music--theoretic

 may be evaluated objectively. In particular, the framework allows
 statements about those compositions to be refuted on the basis of
 empirical experimentation. We consider this to be fundamental if we
 wish to evaluate the degree to which our programs achieve their
 compositional aims. Furthermore, a review of the literature reveals
 that this is a largely ignored aspect of research into algorithmic
 composition. Our framework involves four components: specifying the
 compositional aims; inducing a critic from a set of example musical
 phrases; composing music that satisfies the critic; and evaluating
 specific claims about the compositions in experiments using human
 subjects. We describe a system which exemplifies these four stages
 and which demonstrates the practicality of the framework. Finally,
 the application of the framework to the evaluation of musical
 creativity is discussed and directions for future research are
 suggested.},

 behaving creatively, it is important to be explicit, and if possible
 formal, about the criteria that are being applied in making
 judgements of creativity. We propose a formal (and rather simplified)
 outline of the relevant attributes of a potentially creative
 program. Based on this, we posit a number of formal criteria that
 could be applied to rate the extent to which the program has behaved
 creatively. A guiding principle is that the question of what
 computational mechanisms might lead to creative behaviour is open and
 empirical, and hence we should clearly distinguish between judgements
 about creative achievements and theoretical proposals about
 potentially creative mechanisms. The intention is to focus, clarify
 and make more concrete the debate about creative programs.},

@inproceedings{Sloman01,
	Abstract = {In the last decade and a half, the study of affect in
 general and emotion in particular has become fashionable in
 scientific psychology, cognitive science and AI, both for scientific
 purposes and for the purpose of designing synthetic characters in
 games and entertainments. Such work understandably starts from
 concepts of ordinary language (e.g. ``emotion'', ``feeling'',
 ``mood'', etc.). However, these concepts can be deceptive: they
 appear to have clear meanings but are used in very imprecise and
 systematically ambiguous ways. This is often because of explicit or
 implicit theories about mental states and process. In the Cognition
 and Affect project we have been attempting to explore the benefits of
 developing architecture--based concepts, i.e. starting with
 specifications of architectures for complete agents and then finding
 out what sorts of states and processes are supported by those
 architectures. So, instead of presupposing one theory of the
 architecture and explicitly or implicitly basing concepts on that, we
 define a space of architectures generated by the CogAff architecture
 schema, where each theory supports different collections of
 concepts. In that space we focus on one architecture H--Cogaff, a
 particularly rich instance of the CogAff architecture schema,
 conjectured as a theory of human information processing. The
 architecture--based concepts that it supports provide a framework for
 defining with greater precision than previously a host of mental
 concepts, including affective concepts. We then find that these map
 more or less loosely onto various pre--theoretical concepts, such as
 ``emotion'', etc. We indicate some of the variety of emotion concepts
 generated by the H--Cogaff architecture A different architecture might
 be appropriate for exploring affective states of insects, or
 reptiles, or other mammals, or even young children.},

	Abstract = {Melodic expectations are important in creating patterns
 of tension and relaxation. The way expectations are formed has been
 modeled with tonal hierarchies (Krumhansl & Kessler, 1982)and
 realization of implied intervals (Narmour, 1990). These models have
 been extensively investigated by asking listeners to rate different
 possible melodic continuations. However, these models and
 experimental methods utilize a limited musical context and probe the
 melody at only one point in time. To clarify the role of a more
 extended musical context in expectation formation, a more dynamic
 approach is taken in this study. The aim was to collect continuous
 ratings of melodic predictability from listeners using monophonic
 melodies. The dynamics of the continuous ratings were assessed by
 various models. Listeners rated the predictability of melodies
 simultaneously while the melody is playing. Two sets of melodies were
 used: Experiment 1 contained 40 folk melodies with varying degrees of
 predictability whereas Experiment 2 consisted of 27 artificial
 isochronous sequences. Listeners ?predictability ratings of melodies
 were predicted with three models. Model 1 consisted of Narmour ?s
 implication-realization principles supplemented with tonal stability
 and melodic anchoring. Model 2 was based on recursive probability
 distributions of two-tone continuations where the initial
 probabilities were derived from a large corpus of folk
 melodies. Model 3 comprised the entropy of the distribution of the
 tones within a moving window. Additionally, the applicability of an
 initial key-finding algorithm in the models was investigated. It was
 found that continuous rating of melodies provides relevant
 information of dynamic musical processes. Dynamic models supplement
 the existing models of melodic expectations by extending their
 context sensitivity. The limitations and advantages of the continuous

 expectation are learned rather than innate. In an experiment, 28
 trained musicians and 12 non-musicians were asked to predict the
 direction of controlled experimental melodies. Whereas the musicians{\'\i}
 expectations fit two well-known rules, the rules were not evident in
 the expectancies of non-musicians. Moreover, the rules corresponded
 only approximately to melodic structure, suggesting the rough
 heuristics that people use to make predictions in other cognitive
 domains. In sum, the results suggest that musicians have learned
 imperfect but serviceable heuristics for making predictions in their
 area of expertise.},

	Abstract = {It has been shown that listeners are sensitive to pitch distributional information in music (Oram & Cuddy, 1995; Krumhansl, Louhivuori, Toiviainen, J{{\"a}}rvinen, & Eerola, 1999). However, it is uncertain whether frequency-based musical features are sufficient in explaining listeners' similarity judgements which underlie listeners' classification processes. A similarity rating experiment was designed to determine the effectiveness of these features in predicting listeners' similarity ratings. The material consisted of 15 melodies representing five folk music styles. A multiple regression analysis showed that the similarity of frequency-based musical properties could account for a moderate amount (40%) of listeners' similarity ratings. A slightly better predictive rate (55%) was achieved using descriptive variables such as number of tones, rhythmic variability and melodic predictability. The results suggest that both measures were able to capture some aspects of the structures which portray common salient dimensions to which listeners pay attention whilst categorizing melodies.},
	Annote = {Task: Predict subjects' similarity ratings for pairs of folk melodies from different countries by similarity measures based on a) statistical parameters of melodies, b) descriptive variables (Krumhansl's tonal stability, Narmour's IR descriptiors, mean and range, rhythmic qualities (syncopation, variability etc.)).

Statistical parameters:
- Distribution of pitches, intervals, durations, 2-tone transitions, interval transitions, durations transistion
- Variants by:
-- raw pitch-duration information
-- pitches weighted by durations
-- metrical hierarchy (weighted according to Lerdahl & Jackendoff?)

Similarity between ratings:
- Significant correlation
- MDS (ALSCAL): not very clear grouping of melodies from same country

Prediction with linear regression:
- Hierarchy < raw < duration weighting < all 3 statistical combined < descriptive variables < statistical+descriptive combined (R^2=0.74, possible overfitting)

@article{Ockelford04,
	Abstract = {Following a review of the model of similarity perception, cue abstraction and categorization, developed and empirically tested by Deliege and others   over the last decade or so, it is proposed that the notion of perceivedderivation may be a key additional element in the cognition of musical structure. Evidence is sought in the re-analysis of recent empirical work  and through the identification of structures that appear to challenge the sufficiency of Deliege's model. The issue is contextualized through a discussion of the concepts of similarity, sameness and salience, utilizing contemporary thinking in cognitive psychology, philosophy and music theory-strands of thought which are drawn together through Ockelford's  zygonic' theory of music-structural   understanding. This leads to the formulation of a new, composite account of how musical structure is processed, in which similarity, salience, derivation,categorization and schematization are shown to function in an integrated way.

@article{Temperley04,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the application of Bayesian probabilistic modeling to issues of music cognition and music theory. The main concern is with the problem of key-finding: the process of inferring the key from a pattern of notes. The Bayesian perspective leads to a simple, elegant, and highly effective model of this process; the same approach can also be extended to other aspects of music perception, such as metrical structure and melodic structure. Bayesian modeling also relates in interesting ways to a number of other musical issues, including musical tension, ambiguity, expectation, and the quantitative description of styles and stylistic differences.},
	Annote = {Aim:
Define symbolic key finder as a Bayes model

Target variable:
Tonality (key) labels of subsequent bars of musical piece (categorical)

Predictor:
Pitch class distribution of bar (interval)

Data:
Bar-wise tonality annotations of (40?) pieces of common practice music

Method:
Use Bayes rule to calculate probabilities of all keys, given a distribution of pitch classes in a music segment.
Use pitch class profiles as priors.
Incorporate prior for a segment to be the same as the previous segment (0.8).
No information about horizontal and vertical arrangement of pitches in segment.
No use of harmonic information (which chords are pitches incorporated in).
Model similar to Temperley's revised Krumhansl-Schmuckler model (Temperley, 2001). Major difference: information on pitches missing for a key is incorporated (1- weigth of note in profile).

Results:
Bayes model (86.5% correct), Temp revised (86.3%), K-S (80.4%).
Test done on the corpus of parameter estimation
No test for significance of differences in test results

Possible improvements:
- Learn modulation probability from corpus (actually worse results!)
- set prior for major/minor key
- Learn priors for modulation from key 1 to 2
- use weighted inpout vector, possibly only on important events of a piece

Other implication for Bayesian music modeling:
- Absolute probability values can tell something about stability (or tension) of keys or tonalness
- relative probability values (e.g. best to second-best) can tell something about ambiguity for key perception
- Bayes models can be seen as quantification of preference rule systems
- Quantification of differences between musical styles possible and mutual parameters with a style (e.g. rubato vs. syncopation)},

@article{VinesNuzzoEtAl05,
	Annote = {Aim: Quantifying dynamic nature of music and human responses to it.

Method: Measure subjects' estimation of tension in a musical performance as the move a slider up and down.

Material: Stravinsky 2dn piece for Soloclarinet.
 Subjects: 28 Musically trained subjects
Conditions: Music only, vision only, music+vision

Analysis (=Functional Data Analysis):
Target variable: Subjective musical tension as time series data (interval)
Aggregate and smooth target variable over subjects by fiiting 150 6th order B-splines to averaged time series data
Plot 1st vs. 2dn derivative of fitted curve over time => {"Phase-plane plot"} (reflects {"potential and kinetic affective energy"})
Compare plots of 3 different experimental groups

Results:
- Tension follows musical structure (only rough hand-made musical analysis)
- Flow of affective energy is largest with auditory presentation
- Affective energy flow is weaker with visual only, but can be conveyed through performers' body movements; out of phase with music
- music+vision is influenced by phase-advanced visual information

Advantages of technique:
- study of continous measures => reveal underlying structures
- no assumtion of idependence of observations
- curve of multiple observations is fundamental unit
- complementary to time series analysis: no assumption about stationarity of of process, rather explore global changes over time
- comes with tools for different analyses: correlation, GLM, PCA, significance testing; but always with functions of time as analysis units

	Abstract = {Measurement of the perception and production of simple rhythmic patterns have been shown not to be in line in some cases. In this study it is demonstrated that a Bayesian approach provides a new way of understanding this difference, by formalizing the perceptual competition between mental representations and assuming possible nonuniform a priori probabilities of the rhythmic categories. Thus we can relate the two kinds of information and predict perception data from production data. In this approach, the contrast between rhythm perception and production data, taken from different studies in the literature, was shown almost to disappear, assembling independent prior probabilities from counts of patterns in corpora of musical scores, or from a theoretical measure of rhythmic complexity. The success of this Bayesian formalization may be interpreted as an optimal adaptation of our perceptual system to the environment in which the produced rhythms occur.},
	Annote = {Observation+Motivation:
Inconsistency between deviations from strict mechanical timing in rhythm production and perception experiments: Perceptual deviations seem to enhance contrast between uneven duration intervals, prodution tends to assimilate durations of time intervals (e.g. Sternberg et al., 1982). Explanations proposed but differences haven't been predicted.

Hypothesis:
In production only target pattern is activated, in perception one of several candidates is chosen. Candidate rhythms that are more common and are more likely to be chosen => Bayesian modelling using priors that reflect familiarity of subjects with rhythm patterns

Aim:
Predict rhythm perception data from rhythm production data using Bayes modelling (introducing priors). This is better than prediction from production data only.

Target variables:
Difference between perceived and physical length of interonset intervals for several quantised duration values (from existing experimental studies (???) (interval))

Predictors:
Difference between between produced and physical length of interonset intervals for several quantised duration values (from existing experimental studies (???) (interval))

Priors:
Uniform distribution of rhythms
Priors according to complexity (Farey tree, e.g. Peper et al., 1995)
Priors according rhythm frequency counts in 3 different corpora
Priors are fitted to data as parameters (only as ceiling boundary for other models)

Model evaluation:
Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test for difference of distributions of predicted and observed differences

Data:
Production and perception data from four different previous (unrelated) studies => meta study!

Results:
Generally (1 execption) priors from corpora and Farey tree are better than uniform priors and better than direct comparison. Optimal priors are always best.},

	Abstract = {The unrehearsed performance of music, called `sight-reading' (SR), is a basic skill for all musicians. It is of particular interest for musical occupations such as the piano accompanist, the conductor, or the correpetiteur. However, up until now, there is no theory of SR which considers all relevant factors such as practice-related variables (e.g. expertise), speed of information processing (e.g. mental speed), or psychomotor speed (e.g. speed of trills). Despite the merits of expertise theory, there is no comprehensive model that can classify subjects into high- and low-performance groups. In contrast to previous studies, this study uses a data mining approach instead of regression analysis and tries to classify subjects into predetermined achievement classes. It is based on an extensive experiment in which the total SR performance of 52 piano students at a German music department was measured by use of an accompanying task. Additionally, subjects completed a set of psychological tests, such as tests of mental speed, reaction time, working memory, inner hearing, etc., which were found in earlier studies to be useful predictors of SR achievement. For the first time, classification methods (cluster analysis, regression trees, classification trees, linear discriminant analysis) were applied to determine combinations of variables for classification. Results of a linear discriminant analysis revealed a two-class solution with four predictors (cross-validated error: 15%) and a three-class solution with five predictors (cross-validated error: 33%).},
	Annote = {Aim:
Identify variables responsible for good sight-reading skills from 27 predictors.

Method and results:

Linear regression (R^2=0.65)

Find suitable ranges for classes of continuos achievement scale by k-means clustering, then predict cluster membership by:
2-class LDA (crossval error=15%)
3-class LDA (crossval error= 33%)
2 class classtree (crossval error= 44%)
3 class classtree (crossval error= 19%)
3 class regtree (crossval error= 33%)

Best predictors:

@article{KempTenenbaum08,
	Abstract = {Algorithms for finding structure in data have become increasingly important both as tools for scientific data analysis and as models of human learning, yet they suffer from a critical limitation. Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g., ``bigger than'' or ``better than'') respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

@article{CarotaPosadaEtAl10,
	Abstract = {When we talk we communicate our intentions. Although the origin of intentional action is debated in cognitive neuroscience, the question of how the brain generates the intention in speech remains still open. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated the cortical dynamics engaged when healthy subjects attended to either their intention to speak or their actual speech. We found that activity in the right and left parietal cortex increased before subjects became aware of intending to speak. Within the time window of parietal activation, we also observed a transient left frontal activity in Broca's area, a crucial region for inner speech. During attention to speech, neural activity was detected in left prefrontal and temporal areas and in the temporoparietal junction. In agreement with previous results, our findings suggest that the parietal cortex plays a multimodal role in monitoring intentional mechanisms in both action and language. The coactivation of parietal regions and Broca's area may constitute the cortical circuit specific for controlling intentional processes during speech.

	Abstract = {A free-energy principle has been proposed recently that accounts for action, perception and learning. This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

@article{EdelmanGallyEtAl11,
	Abstract = {The Dynamic Core and Global Workspace hypotheses were independently put forward to provide mechanistic and biologically plausible accounts of how brains generate conscious mental content.  The Dynamic Core proposes that reentrant neural activity in the thalamocortical system gives rise to conscious experience.  Global Workspace reconciles the limited capacity of momentary conscious content with the vast repertoire of long term memory. In this paper we show the close relationship between the two hypotheses.  This relationship allows for a strictly biological account of phenomenal experience and subjectivity that is consistent with mounting experimental evidence.  We examine the constraints on causal analyses of consciousness and suggest that there is now sufficient evidence to consider the design and construction of a conscious artifact.},

	Abstract = {In coming to understand the world---in learning concepts, acquiring language, and grasping causal relations---our minds make inferences that appear to go far beyond the data available. How do we do it? This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?},

@article{MacCallumMauchEtAl12,
	Abstract = {Music evolves as composers, performers, and consumers favor some musical variants over others. To investigate the role of consumer selection, we constructed a Darwinian music engine consisting of a population of short audio loops that sexually reproduce and mutate. This population evolved for 2,513 generations under the selective influence of 6,931 consumers who rated the loops' aesthetic qualities. We found that the loops quickly evolved into music attributable, in part, to the evolution of aesthetically pleasing chords and rhythms. Later, however, evolution slowed. Applying the Price equation, a general description of evolutionary processes, we found that this stasis was mostly attributable to a decrease in the fidelity of transmission. Our experiment shows how cultural dynamics can be explained in terms of competing evolutionary forces.},

@article{Fitch13,
	Abstract = {This paper outlines a cognitive and comparative perspective on human rhythmic cognition that emphasizes a key distinction between pulse perception and meter perception. Pulse perception involves the extraction of a regular pulse or ``tactus''from a stream of events. Meter perception involves grouping of events into hierarchical trees with differing levels of ``strength'', or perceptual prominence. I argue that metrically-structured rhythms are required to either perform or move appropriately to music (e.g., to dance). Rhythms, from this metrical perspective, constitute ``trees in time.''Rhythmic syntax represents a neglected form of musical syntax, and warrants more thorough neuroscientific investigation. The recent literature on animal entrainment clearly demonstrates the capacity to extract the pulse from rhythmic music, and to entrain periodic movements to this pulse, in several parrot species and a California sea lion, and a more limited ability to do so in one chimpanzee. However, the ability of these or other species to infer hierarchical rhythmic trees remains, for the most part, unexplored (with some apparent negative results from macaques). The results from this animal comparative research, combined with new methods to explore rhythmic cognition neurally, provide exciting new routes for understanding not just rhythmic cognition, but hierarchical cognition more generally, from a biological and neural perspective.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies of auditory expectation have focused on the expectedness perceived by listeners retrospectively in response to events. In contrast, this research examines predictive uncertainty---a property of listeners' prospective state of expectation prior to the onset of an event. We examine the information-theoretic concept of Shannon entropy as a model of predictive uncertainty in music cognition. This is motivated by the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, which proposes that schematic expectations reflect probabilistic relationships between sensory events learned implicitly through exposure. Using probability estimates from an unsupervised, variable-order Markov model, 12 melodic contexts high in entropy and 12 melodic contexts low in entropy were selected from two musical repertoires differing in structural complexity (simple and complex). Musicians and non-musicians listened to the stimuli and provided explicit judgments of perceived uncertainty (explicit uncertainty). We also examined an indirect measure of uncertainty computed as the entropy of expectedness distributions obtained using a classical probe-tone paradigm where listeners rated the perceived expectedness of the final note in a melodic sequence (inferred uncertainty). Finally, we simulate listeners' perception of expectedness and uncertainty using computational models of auditory expectation. A detailed model comparison indicates which model parameters maximize fit to the data and how they compare to existing models in the literature. The results show that listeners experience greater uncertainty in high-entropy musical contexts than low-entropy contexts. This effect is particularly apparent for inferred uncertainty and is stronger in musicians than non-musicians. Consistent with the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, the results suggest that increased domain-relevant training is associated with an increasingly accurate cognitive model of probabilistic structure in music.},

	Abstract = {Increases in EEG alpha power during creative ideation are among the most consistent findings in the neuroscientific study of creativity, but existing studies did not focus on time-related changes of EEG alpha activity patterns during the process of creative ideation so far. Since several cognitive processes are involved in the generation of creative ideas, different EEG correlates may result as a function of time. In this study we addressed this crucial point. Forty-five participants worked on the ``Alternative Uses Task'' while the EEG was recorded and changes in task-related power (relative to rest) in the upper-frequency band (10--12 Hz) for three isochronous time intervals of the idea generation period were determined. Alpha power changes during idea generation followed a characteristic time course: we found a general increase of alpha power at the beginning of idea generation that was followed by a decrease and finally by a re-increase of alpha prior to responding that was most pronounced at parietal and temporal sites of the right hemisphere. Additionally, the production of more original ideas was accompanied by increasing hemispheric asymmetry (more alpha in the right than left hemisphere) with increasing duration of the idea generation period. The observed time course of brain activity may reflect the progression of different but well-known stages in the idea generation process: that is the initial retrieval of common and old ideas followed by the actual generation of novel and more creative ideas by overcoming typical responses through processes of mental simulation and imagination.},

	Abstract = {Creativity is the hallmark of human cognition and is behind every innovation, scientific discovery, piece of music, artwork, and idea that have shaped our lives, from ancient times till today. Yet scientific understanding of creative processes is quite limited, mostly due to the traditional belief that considers creativity as a mysterious puzzle, a paradox, defying empirical enquiry. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in revealing the neural correlates of human creativity. Though many of these studies, pioneering in nature, help demystification of creativity, but the field is still dominated by popular beliefs in associating creativity with ``right brain thinking'', ``divergent thinking'', ``altered states'' and so on (Dietrich and Kanso, 2010). In this article, we discuss a computational framework for creativity based on Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT; Baars, 1988) enhanced with mechanisms based on information theory. Next we propose a neurocognitive architecture of creativity with a strong focus on various facets (i.e., unconscious thought theory, mind wandering, spontaneous brain states) of un/pre-conscious brain responses. Our principal argument is that pre-conscious creativity happens prior to conscious creativity and the proposed computational model may provide a mechanism by which this transition is managed. This integrative approach, albeit unconventional, will hopefully stimulate future neuroscientific studies of the inscrutable phenomenon of creativity.},

The present paper describes an effort to create a different instantiation of PoeTryMe, this time focused on the production of poems in Spanish. The instantiation effort involved the creation of a set of triplets of relations to represent the semantics of Spanish terms, the extraction of a grammar of templates for Spanish from a corpus of Spanish poetry, the application of a different tool for Spanish syllabic division, the integration of the various modules, and several experiments with the resulting system.},

	Abstract = {Human language, music and a variety of animal vocalizations constitute ways of sonic communication that exhibit remarkable structural complexity. While the complexities of language and possible parallels in animal communication have been discussed intensively, reflections on the complexity of music and animal song, and their comparisons, are underrepresented. In some ways, music and animal songs are more comparable to each other than to language as propositional semantics cannot be used as indicator of communicative success or wellformedness, and notions of grammaticality are less easily defined. This review brings together accounts of the principles of structure building in music and animal song. It relates them to corresponding models in formal language theory, the extended Chomsky hierarchy (CH), and their probabilistic counterparts. We further discuss common misunderstandings and shortcomings concerning the CH and suggest ways to move beyond. We discuss language, music and animal song in the context of their function and motivation and further integrate problems and issues that are less commonly addressed in the context of language, including continuous event spaces, features of sound and timbre, representation of temporality and interactions of multiple parallel feature streams. We discuss these aspects in the light of recent theoretical, cognitive, neuroscientific and modelling research in the domains of music, language and animal song.},

	Abstract = {This article discusses the relation between communication and conceptual grounding. In the brain, neurons, circuits and brain areas are involved in the representation of a concept, grounding it in perception and action. In terms of grounding we can distinguish between communication within the brain and communication between humans or between humans and machines. In the first form of communication, a concept is activated by sensory input. Due to grounding, the information provided by this communication is not just determined by the sensory input but also by the outgoing connection structure of the conceptual representation, which is based on previous experiences and actions. The second form of communication, that between humans or between humans and machines, is influenced by the first form. In particular, a more successful interpersonal communication might require forms of situated cognition and interaction in which the entire representations of grounded concepts are involved},

We address two key questions: (i) what cognitive and/or social mechanisms have evolved that afford aspects of creativity?; (ii) has natural and/or sexual selection favoured human behaviours considered {\textquoteleft}creative{\textquoteright}? This entails analysis of {\textquoteleft}creativity{\textquoteright}, an imprecise construct: comparable properties in non-humans differ in magnitude and teleology from generally agreed human creativity. We then address two apparent problems: (i) the difference between merely novel productions and {\textquoteleft}creative{\textquoteright} ones; (ii) the emergence of creative behaviour in spite of high cost: does it fit the idea that females choose a male who succeeds in spite of a handicap (costly ornament); or that creative males capable of producing a large and complex song repertoire grew up under favourable conditions; or a demonstration of generally beneficial heightened reasoning capacity; or an opportunity to continually reinforce social bonding through changing communication tropes; or something else? We illustrate and support our argument by reference to whale and bird song; these independently evolved biological signal mechanisms objectively share surface properties with human behaviours generally called {\textquoteleft}creative{\textquoteright}.

Indeed, they are difficult to reconcile and use in a single collaborative environment. We claim that finding ways to integrate smoothly both approaches is the only real bottleneck to producing reliable automatic harmonic analyzers.},

	Abstract = {DOMINIE - Domain independent instructional environment.
            Multiple teaching and assessment strategies.
            Teaching students how to use computer-based interfaces.
		Domain independence limited to being able to tutor on different
		applications with different interfaces.  Domain
		knowledge input by a non-computer expert via a special
		interface.
	    K.R. is task-based - focusses on user's goals.  Generates
		a goal hierarchy to satisfy a high-level goal, then
		uses strategies to impart that hierarchy to the
		student.  (Goal Conditions, Actions, links to related
		conceptual info).
	    System also has knowledge about the set of possible
		actions, which are parameterised on type, object,
		location, parameters and have screenshots associated
		with them.
	    Student model: simple overlay plus short-term states
		(bored, confused) which are based on self-reports and
		success of different strategies.
            Also has a dialogue history - record of interaction to
		provide context.
	    Dominie strategies:
	    Cognitive Apprenticeship - based on way of learning crafts
		from an expert - observe, then do small parts and
		build up to whole thing.
	    Successive Refinement - top-down approach (breadth first).
	    Discovery Learning - some disagreement about just how free
		the student is - some d.l. advocates use carefully
		structured tasks to control the sequence of
		discoveries. In Dominie, teacher is present and
		selects an achievable task which involves the right
		level of new material.  The only techniques used is
		analogy.
	    Abstraction - take existing knowledge and make links,
		generalise.
	    Socratic Diagnosis - In original form, pupil has a flawed
		model, teacher is aware of flaw and asks questions
		intended to highlight it to the student.  Others use
		'concept decomposition'.  Socratic Dialogue where
		teacher asks questions in order to identify flaws in
		the student's knowledge.  Dominie, when it detects an
		error, builds a 'likely path' to the error by asking
		u.m. which subcomponents are least well understood.
	    Practice - ask student to perform some tasks and monitor
		them.  Immediate feedback i they go wrong.
	    Cognitive Assessment - follows Cog. App.
	    Direct Assessment - Q's and A's on declarative knowledge
		(multi-choice and slot filling).
	    Selection of strateges:
		- balance teaching and assessment (some teaching
		  strategies imply frequent or less frequent
		  assessment)
		- match teaching strategy and topic
		- student's history of success w/ each strategy
		- student's personal preferences
		Makes a strategy decision after every cycle.
                Student can choose too (teach vs assess), and choose
		to revise or browse forward (neither of those 2 is
		modelled, as reason for using them not known.)
	    Control loop:
		- teach vs assess decision
		- topic/activity
		- method/strategy
		- specific procedure (bit like example).
	    Has no explicit model of the teaching/learning process.
	    Lots more scope for research into switching decisions for
		strategies - a novel problem.
            Can only make major strategy shifts - can't go bit by bit.},

We present data gathered from human subjects regarding their ratings of these properties over a set of word pairs speci cally designed to exhibit varying degrees of metaphoricity. We then investigate whether these properties  can  be  measured  in  terms  of  geometric  features  of  a  model of distributional lexical semantics. We compare the performance of two
models, our own Concept Discovery Model which dynamically constructs context-sensitive  subspaces,  and  a  state-of-the-art  static  distributional semantic model, and  nd that our dynamic model performs signi cantly better in its measurement of metaphoricity.},

	Abstract = { Multiple viewpoint systems find statistical structure in multi-dimensional entities, such as music, by combining Markov-based models together in order to make probabilistic predictions. This paper empirically tests two contrasting techniques for predicting multiple attributes of a musical surface. The first, an established method, predicts each attribute in turn, whilst a second, a proposed alternative, merges attributes into a new representation in order to make predictions simultaneously. A set of optimal smoothing techniques are found for both prediction methods across several harmonic and melodic datasets. Results indicate that when surface attributes are highly correlated, predicting merged attributes outperforms predicting the attributes separately. This can allow viewpoint systems with correlated surface attributes to be optimized, giving a closer fit with the training data as measured by mean information content. },

	Abstract = {Feeling the beat and meter is fundamental to the experience of music. However, how these periodicities are represented in the brain remains largely unknown. Here, we test whether this function emerges from the entrainment of neurons resonating to the beat and meter. We recorded the electroencephalogram while participants listened to a musical beat and imagined a binary or a ternary meter on this beat (i.e., a march or a waltz). We found that the beat elicits a sustained periodic EEG response tuned to the beat frequency. Most importantly, we found that meter imagery elicits an additional frequency tuned to the corresponding metric interpretation of this beat. These results provide compelling evidence that neural entrainment to beat and meter can be captured directly in the electroencephalogram. More generally, our results suggest that music constitutes a unique context to explore entrainment phenomena in dynamic cognitive processing at the level of neural networks.},

@article{Clayton07,
	Abstract = {Entrainment has been suggested as an important phenomenon underlying aspects of musical behaviour, and is attracting increasing attention in music psychology (see e.g. Large and Jones, 1999; Large, 2000), and in ethnomusicology (Clayton, Sager and Will, 2005). Approaches to its study in ethnomusicology must address a significant methodological problem: how to study entrainment phenomena in an ecologically valid manner, and to integrate this process into a programme of ethnographic research. Video recordings contain important data regarding the physical movements of participants in musical events (as well as their audible results), and through the application of observational analysis software these recordings can form the basis of studies of entrainment between different quasi- periodic musical processes as manifested in movement patterns. For the present study a short video clip of an Indian raga performance was selected (taken from a performance of Shree Rag by the singer Veena Sahasrabuddhe). Observational analysis was carried out using The Observer Video-Pro software, configured to record the plucking of tanpura strings and performers' beat markers (hand or finger taps). Time series data thus generated were analysed using calculations of phase relationships, revealing several instances of both self- and interpersonal entrainment (the stated intention of the performers is, on the contrary, that the tanpura rhythms should each proceed independently). Entrainment between these behaviours points to a complex, but unintended form of emergent order. This unexpected result demonstrates the usefulness of this method in revealing otherwise unnoticed phenomena in musical performance, and raises important questions for future research.},
